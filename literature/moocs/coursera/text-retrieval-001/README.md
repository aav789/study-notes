# Text Retrieval and Search Engines

## Week 1

### 1.1 Natural Language Processing

* NLP metaphor: think of how you would understand some text in a foreign language. The concept for computers is similar.
* What NLP can't do:

  * 100% POS tagging: "He turned *off* the highway" vs "he turned *off* the fan".
  * General complete parsing: 
    * "A man saw a boy with a telescope"
  * Precise deep semantic analysis:
    * "Bob *owns* a restaurant."
      * What does *owns* means in this context?

### 1.2 Text Access

* Two modes of text access: push and pull.
* Pull
  * User asks computer.
  * Search engine example.
  * Two modes:
    * Querying: user knows what they want to search for.
    * Browsing: user doesn't know what they want.
* Push
  * Computer recommends to user.
  * Netflix recommended example.
  * Computer needs to know about user's needs (unless needs are "stable" eg news site displaying most recent or most popular articles).
