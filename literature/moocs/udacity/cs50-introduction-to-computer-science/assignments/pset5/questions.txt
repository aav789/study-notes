hMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG

0. How many different colors does each format support?

JPG - up to 24-bit color, variable compression, lossy, no alpha support
PNG - up to 48-bit color, moderate compression, lossless, alpha support
BMP - up to 24-bit color, very little compression, lossless alpha support
GIF - up to 8-bit color, little compression, lossless, transparency support, animation support

1. Which of the formats supports animation.

Gif is only one that supports animation completely. Others like PNG (MNG, APNG) and JPEG (MJPEG) have animation specs but they're not commonly implemented.

2. What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?

Lossy compression refers to the process of getting a smaller size by removing bytes. Lossless allows exact (for a computer) original to be reconstructed from the compressed data.

3. Which of the formats is lossy-compression?

JPG, PNG and GIF are lossy formats


6.  What's stdint.h?

A C header declaration that determines a set of integer types which have specified widths.

7. What's the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, t, int32_t, uint16_t?

To save memory if large ints aren't required.

8. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

BYTE - 1 byte (8 bits)
LONG - 8 bytes (though used to be 4 bytes)
DWORD (double word) - 4 bytes (32 bits)
WORD - 2 bytes (16 bits) 
QWORD - 4 bytes (32 bits)

9. What must the first two bytes of any BMP be?

'bfType' in the Bitmap File Header.

10. What's the difference between bfSize & biSize?

bfSize - describes entire file size in bytes.
biSize - is the size of the BitmapInfoHeader

11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

Indicates vertical orientation of the image is top-down.

12. What field in BitmapInfoHeader specifies the BMP's color depth (ie, bits per pixel)?

biBitCount

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:31?

The file doesn't exist or you don't have permission to access it.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in the code?

We are only every opening one char per read.

15. What value does copy.c:72 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

??

16. What does fseek do?

Set the file-position indicator for the stream pointed to the first argument, ahead 2nd argument bytes in the file.

17. What is SEEK_CUR?

Indicates whether offset is relative to curret file position.
