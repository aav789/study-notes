## Introduction

* Lots of books about writing, but most on how to do citations or how to over come procrastination; few about note taking.
* Writing is much easier when ordering an existing collection of writing than starting from a blank page.
* Good note taking is setting yourself up for success

## 1. Everything You Need To Know

* Having a structured workflow that you trust allows you to enter [[Flow State]]
* GTD is a good example of a workflow effective for work with clearly defined tasks.
* Writing, however, needs to be more open-ended and consists of lots of small tasks, like rereading chapters and looking up footnotes, that cannot be defined as a linear to do list.

* [[Niklas Luhmann]] a prolific sociologists system for taking notes:
	* 2 "slipboxes" consisting of index cards, one for taking bibliographical notes and another for collecting and generating ideas.
	* In the first, he would add cards with bibliographic info on one side and notes about the content on the other.
	* In the second, he would look at notes in the first box and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing and use to add ideas to the 2nd.
	* The 2nd was one idea per card, he made them such that he could understand them without pulling out the card, but also in full sentences with explicit references to literature.
	* Each card had an numbered index. He would then slot new ideas next to their closest neighbour and use a character to increment the number ie one note may be 1234 and the next 1234a.
	* When adding a new note he would check the slipbox to try to make connections between ideas. Some by slotting next to each other, others by referencing other cards by id potentially anywhere in the box, allowing him to add the same note to different contexts.
	* Last element in the file system was a note which contained one or two notes per topic which served as their entry point.
