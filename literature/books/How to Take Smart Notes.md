## Introduction

* Lots of books about writing, but most on how to do citations or how to over come procrastination; few about note taking.
* Writing is much easier when ordering an existing collection of writing than starting from a blank page.
* Good note taking is setting yourself up for success

## 1. Everything You Need To Know

* Having a structured workflow that you trust allows you to enter [[Flow State]]
* GTD is a good example of a workflow effective for work with clearly defined tasks.
* Writing, however, needs to be more open-ended and consists of lots of small tasks, like rereading chapters and looking up footnotes, that cannot be defined as a linear to do list.

* [[Niklas Luhmann]] a prolific sociologists system for taking notes:
	* 2 "slipboxes" consisting of index cards, one for taking bibliographical notes and another for collecting and generating ideas.
	* In the first, he would add cards with bibliographic info on one side and notes about the content on the other.
	* In the second, he would look at notes in the first box and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing and use to add ideas to the 2nd.
	* The 2nd was one idea per card, he made them such that he could understand them without pulling out the card, but also in full sentences with explicit references to literature.
	* Each card had an numbered index. He would then slot new ideas next to their closest neighbour and use a character to increment the number ie one note may be 1234 and the next 1234a.
	* When adding a new note he would check the slipbox to try to make connections between ideas. Some by slotting next to each other, others by referencing other cards by id potentially anywhere in the box, allowing him to add the same note to different contexts.
	* Last element in the file system was a note which contained one or two notes per topic which served as their entry point.

## 2. Everything You Need To Do

* The hardest part of the process of writing something meaningful is in the reading and thinking. The process of ordering notes, writing early drafts using notes and performing final edits is actually quite light work mentally.
* Writing is the best, perhaps the only, "facilitator" for reading, writing and any intellectual endeavour.
* Writing a paper step by step:
	* Make fleeting notes: always have something on hand to take notes as a reminder of what's in your head. Put them in a place that you define as inbox to process later.
	* Make literature notes: when you read, take notes about the content. Be very selective and use your own words. Be careful of using quotes in place of actual understanding. Keep bibliographic reference with your lit notes.
	* Make permanent notes: go through notes made in step 1 or 2 and consider how they relate to your interests. Once you have a full slipbox, it can be done by looking at how closely they align with existing notes.
		* Write one note for each idea
		* Use full sentences, disclouse sources, make references and try to be precise, clear and brief as possible.
	* Add permanent notes to slipbox by:
		* Filing each note behind one or more related notes
		* Add links to related notes
		* Ensure you find it later by linking from your index or making a link on a note that's an entry point to discussion or topic, which is linked by index.
	* Use your slipbox to develop interests, find holes, to ask questions.
		* You may develop new interests as you gain new insights.
	* Eventually, you have enough notes to start writing about a topic.
		* Collect notes and put them in order.
			* Initial order won't be 100%: try out ideas and continue to iterate.
	* Turn notes into rough draft: translate them into something coherent.
		* Continue to fix holes in your argument.
	* Edit and proofread your manuscript.
* In reality, you likely work on multiple papers and ideas at a time.
* Some reading may not be useful for a certain pursuit, but may have ideas useful for others.

## 3. Everything You Need to Have

* NASA made a gravity-independent pen in an effort to write in space, Russians simply used pencils.
* The slip-box follows the Russian model: focus on essentials and don't overcomplicate things.
* Students can end up with a lot of different learning and note-taking techniques, simple in isolation but complicated together.
* None of the workflows have tools to help make connections between ideas.
* Slipbox is not another techique but an overarching workflow stripped of everything that distracts from stuff that's important.
* The Slipbox Tool Box:
	* Something to write with and something to write on
	* A reference management program
	* The slip-box
	* An editor
* Workflow
	* Any time you have an idea, add it to a notepad or some inbox that you will process later
	* Use a reference management system like Zotero to handle citations, which can be linked to from your reference notes
	* Create a slipbox: either using sheets of paper "about the size of a postcard (Luhmann used the DIN A6 size, 148 x 105 mm or 5.83 x 4.13 inches)" or a program like [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/)
	* Use an editor, preferable that works with Zotero or your reference manager

## 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind

* It's crucial to not just understand how it work, or how to work with it, but why it works. Only then can you modify it for your own needs.
* Book aims to give all resources needed to use the slipbox in the best possible way for your goals.

## The Four Underlying Priniciples

## 5. Writing Is the Only Thing That Matters
* All your note taking should be taken with a focus on writing:
	* Gives a tangible purpose when reading or attending lectures etc.
	* Ensures you read in an engaged way: to paraphrase text you have to understand it.
	* Helps to learn as efficiently as possible and get to the point where open questions arise. These are the things worth writing about.

## 6. Simplicity Is Paramount

* The common system for notetaking used by students and academic fails for the same reason the first iterations of shipping containers did: parts that appear to make sense in isolation can not be combined towards an optimal workflow.
* In a standard note taking system, the question is: what topic do I store this note?
* With Zettelkasten: what context will I want to stumble under this note again?
* Like shipping container, Instead of having different storage for different ideas everything works towards one goal: generating insights that can be published.
* Slipbox works at scale: when more notes are added more value can be derived. However, adding notes indiscriminately lowers value of slipbox.
* To achieve "critical mass" for notes, you must differentiate between:
	* fleeting notes
	* permanent noets
	* project notes
* 3 common mistakes:
	* treat everything as a permanent notes ie scientific journal
		* good ideas get diluted by other ideas
		* ideas order chronologically are difficult to search
	* collect notes only relevant to project
		* you start from scratch each project and cut off relevant lines of thought at the end
		* exception ideas are created over multi-projects
	* treat all notes as fleeting
		* even small amounts of unprocessed notes can lead to sense of out of controlness
	* All have one downside in common: the benefits of the system decreases as more notes are added.
* Fleeting notes vs permanent
	* Fleeting notes are collected if need extra step of understand or grasp an idea
	* Fleeting notes must be processed later
		* Good measure for assessing whether fleeting note was kept too long: if you no longer understand it or appears banal
	* Permanent notes should be written in such a way that you can understand it even when you have long forgotten the original context
* Finally: project notes that don't fit into the slipbox: todo lists, outlines, drafts etc should go in a project specific folder.
	* You can pull relevant notes out of the slipbox into the project folder to experiment with arraguments.

## 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch
