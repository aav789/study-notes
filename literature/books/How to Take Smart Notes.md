## Introduction

* Lots of books about writing, but most on how to do citations or how to over come procrastination; few about note taking.
* Writing is much easier when ordering an existing collection of writing than starting from a blank page.
* Good note taking is setting yourself up for success

## 1. Everything You Need To Know

* Having a structured workflow that you trust allows you to enter [[Flow State]]
* GTD is a good example of a workflow effective for work with clearly defined tasks.
* Writing, however, needs to be more open-ended and consists of lots of small tasks, like rereading chapters and looking up footnotes, that cannot be defined as a linear to do list.

* [[Niklas Luhmann]] a prolific sociologists system for taking notes:
	* 2 "slipboxes" consisting of index cards, one for taking bibliographical notes and another for collecting and generating ideas.
	* In the first, he would add cards with bibliographic info on one side and notes about the content on the other.
	* In the second, he would look at notes in the first box and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing and use to add ideas to the 2nd.
	* The 2nd was one idea per card, he made them such that he could understand them without pulling out the card, but also in full sentences with explicit references to literature.
	* Each card had an numbered index. He would then slot new ideas next to their closest neighbour and use a character to increment the number ie one note may be 1234 and the next 1234a.
	* When adding a new note he would check the slipbox to try to make connections between ideas. Some by slotting next to each other, others by referencing other cards by id potentially anywhere in the box, allowing him to add the same note to different contexts.
	* Last element in the file system was a note which contained one or two notes per topic which served as their entry point.

## 2. Everything You Need To Do

* The hardest part of the process of writing something meaningful is in the reading and thinking. The process of ordering notes, writing early drafts using notes and performing final edits is actually quite light work mentally.
* Writing is the best, perhaps the only, "facilitator" for reading, writing and any intellectual endeavour.
* Writing a paper step by step:
	* Make fleeting notes: always have something on hand to take notes as a reminder of what's in your head. Put them in a place that you define as inbox to process later.
	* Make literature notes: when you read, take notes about the content. Be very selective and use your own words. Be careful of using quotes in place of actual understanding. Keep bibliographic reference with your lit notes.
	* Make permanent notes: go through notes made in step 1 or 2 and consider how they relate to your interests. Once you have a full slipbox, it can be done by looking at how closely they align with existing notes.
		* Write one note for each idea
		* Use full sentences, disclouse sources, make references and try to be precise, clear and brief as possible.
	* Add permanent notes to slipbox by:
		* Filing each note behind one or more related notes
		* Add links to related notes
		* Ensure you find it later by linking from your index or making a link on a note that's an entry point to discussion or topic, which is linked by index.
	* Use your slipbox to develop interests, find holes, to ask questions.
		* You may develop new interests as you gain new insights.
	* Eventually, you have enough notes to start writing about a topic.
		* Collect notes and put them in order.
			* Initial order won't be 100%: try out ideas and continue to iterate.
	* Turn notes into rough draft: translate them into something coherent.
		* Continue to fix holes in your argument.
	* Edit and proofread your manuscript.
* In reality, you likely work on multiple papers and ideas at a time.
* Some reading may not be useful for a certain pursuit, but may have ideas useful for others.
