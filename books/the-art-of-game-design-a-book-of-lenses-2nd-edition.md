Author: [[Jesse Schell]]
Type: #book
Topics: [[game design]]

## One: In the Beginning, There is the Designer
* You only become a game designer by designing games.
* Skills a game designer may use: animation, antropology, architecture, brain storming, business, cinematography, communcation, creative writing, economics, engineering, games, history, management, mathematics, music, psychology, public speaking, sound design, technical writing, visual arts.
	* Though no one can master all the skills, the more you can learn about each the better.
* The most important skill: listening
* 5 major categories: team, audience, game, client and self.
* Reading to consider:
	* [[Cirque de Soleil: The Spark-Igniting the Creative Fire that Lives within Us All]] - book about finding your path.
	* [[Challenges for Game Designers by Brenda Brathwaite and Ian Schreiber]] - a collection of exercises for stretching game design muscles.
* Key takeaway
    * Anyone can become a game designer but it's a skill that requires a lot of diversity of knowledge and the ability to listen and empathise.

## Two: The Designer Creates an Experience
* Goal of game designer is to create a compelling experience for the players.
* "The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience, but it _is not the experience_".
* Game designs have to deal with more interaction than designers of other mediums (ie movies).
* 3 fields that have sought to understand "mysteries of human mind and the secrets of the human heart": psychology, anthropology and design.
* Psychology
	* Behaviorists: focus on measurable behavior
	* Phenomenologists: focus on the nature of human experience and "feeling of what happens"
	* Game designers can make use of both behavioristic experiments and "phenomenological introspection:.
* Anthropology
	* Takes more holistic approach than psycology: looks at physical, mental and cultural aspects of people.
	* Cultural anthroplogists = immerse in studies world, including living with them.
	* Take a cultural anthropological approach to players: interviews, putting ourselves in their places to gain insights that would otherwise not be possible.
* Design
	* Designers seldom publish papers about their findinings.
	* Designers in a field often know little about designers in other fields.
	* Anyone who creates something for others to experience we can learn something from.
* We need to get knowledge from a range of sources, no single field has all the answers we need.
* Introspection: Powers, Peils and Practice
	*  "act of examining your own thoughts and feelings"
	*  two main perils of using introspections:
		*  Peril #1: introspection can lead to false conclusions about reality
			*  not so important to game designers, which are concerned with "feels like true" rather than what is true.
		*  Peril #2: what is true of my experiences may not be true for others
			*  Two extreme approaches to deal with this:
				*  only make games for people like me (ie only trust intuition)
					*  may not be a large enough audience for your unique tastes.
				*  only trust play testing (use no intuition only facts)
					*  some decisions need to be made before there's a game to play test
			* Observe your own experiences, then those of others to see how your experiences differ
	* Dissect your feelings
		* Must be able to analyse how you feel when you play a game.
		* Practice analysing your experience will help find the experiences you want to create from your game.
	* **Lens #1: the Lens of Emotion** #lens
		* What emotions should my players experince?
		* What emotions are they having now? Why?
		* How can I bridge the gap between emotions I want and what they're having?
	* Defeating Heisenberg
		* Heisenberg uncertainty principle from quantum mechancs: "motion of particle can't be observed without distubing the motion of that partical"
		* How can you observe your enjoyment of an experience without tainting that enjoyment?
			* Analyse memories:
				* Technique: engage in experience with intention to not analyze while you play, but immediately afterwards.
					* Requires practice.
			* Two passes:
				* Play once just experiencing.
				* Play again and take notes as you go.
			* Sneak glances:
				* With practice, can sneak glances while experience is happening.
					* Don't get carried away with analysis.
			* Observe silently:
				* It is possible with practice to silently observe your experience without interrupting it.
				* Can practice while watching TV, working etc.
				* Akin to mindfulness meditation: aware of your own autopilot without taking over.
		* Essential experience
			* Games only need the "essence of an experience", not the actual experience.
				* Game designer goal to find the essential experiences.
	* **Lens #2: The Lens of Essential Experience** #lens
		* What experience should the player have?
		* What's essential to it?
		* How can I capture it?
	* Being clear about the essential experience can give you a clearer picture of how to improve the game.
* Key takeaway
    * A game provides the essences of an experience - not the experience itself. Find the experience your game should provide, then the essence of that experience.

## Three: The Experience Takes Place In A Venue

* Mediums come and go but the venues that we consume them in persist.
* Private venues
    * The Hearth
        * People have a evolutionary connection to fire which is why homes have always had fireplaces.
        * The TV screen has replaced the fire in modern lives, and games based around it continue to be popular: Wii Sports, SingStar, Dance Central etc.
    * The Workbench
        * A private place in the house for hard problems.
        * Messy, usually not visited by guests.
        * Where the PC tends to go.
        * Games for here are played in solitude, or with likeminded people online.
        * Usually more difficult and intense.
    * The Reading Nook
        * Reading is usually done in a quiet place away from hearth and workbench.
        * Ipad gaming is a good fit for the reading nook.
* Public venues
    * What venue it is, be sure the experience is something you can't get at home.
    * The Theater
        * Place where large numbers of people experience something together.
        * Few games have made it in the theatre - maybe one day?
    * The Arena
        * Games where the results are public.
        * Some games played on the workbench are set in arena.
        * Few examples of digital games being played in traditional areas - yet...
    * The Museum
        * Including zoos and aquariums as types of museum's, they provide a chance to see the exotic and learn something about our world.
        * Museums are introducing gameplay elements to introduce visitors to information.
* Half Private / Half Public Venues
    * Venues that live in the boundary between privacy of home and openness of public.
    * The Gaming Table
        * Tabletop games, arcade machines, pool tables at bar.
        * Non-digital games are the mainstay of the gaming table, but perhaps touch screens could facilite the introduction of digital games here.
    * The Playground
        * Anywhere improvisational play happens.
        * Children largely play this way as part of their development.
        * Video game industry has largely ignored it but more mobile tech may change that.
* Anywhere
    * Crossword puzzles, sudoku, word find etc.
    * Mobile games.
    * Tend to be playable in "bite sized" chunks.
    * Players tend to prefer them to be free.
* Venues Mixed and Matched
    * Lots of gaps and overlaps with venues: bowling alleys, pinball at a restaurant etc.
    * Important thing is to see past the games and platforms to the venues and their properties.
* **Lens #3: Lens of the Venue** #lens 
	* What venue best suits game i'm creating?
	* Does venue have special properties that will influence the game?
	* What elements are in harmony with game? What elements aren't?
* Reading:
	* [[A Pattern of Language]] by Christopher Alexander et al - book about relationships between humans and spaces.
* Takeaways
    * Understanding what venue your game is designed for, allows you to see past technology and trends to understand your games key properties.

## Four: The Experience Rise Out of a Game
* We want to design experiences, but we cannot do it directly, it's done through a game.
* How can we define "game"?
    * People have slightly different definitions of what a "game" is.
    * Academics view lack of standardised definitions around game design a crisis.
* What Is A Game?
    * Surprise and fun are integral part of game experiences.
    * **Lens #4: The Lens of Surprise** #lens 
        * What will surprise players when they play the game?
        * Does the story have interesting surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
        * Do your rules give players way to surprise each other?
        * Do rules give players way to surprise themselves?
    * **Lens #5: Lens of Fun** #lens 
        * What parts of my game are fun?
        * What parts need to be more fun?
    * A possible definition for fun: "Fun is pleasure with surprises"
    * A possible definition for play: "Play is manipluation that indules curiosity."
    * **Lens #6: The Lens of Curiosity**
        * Consider player's true motivation, not just goals the game defines:
            * What questions does the game create for the player?
            * Can I create more questions for the player?
        * Example: maze-finding game with a time limit: "can I find my way through maze in 30 seconds"
        * Another question: "What will happen in the story after I complete this level?"
    * One possible definition of a game: "Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems, in which there is a contest between powers, confinded by rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome" - Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith
        * Leads to some key qualities of games:
            * Games are entered willfully.
            * Games have goals.
            * Games have conflict.
            * Games have rules.
            * Games can be won and lost.
    * Another possible definition: "(A game is) an  interactive structure of endogenous meaning that requires players struggle toward a goal" - Greg Costikyan
        * Interactive structure = player is active.
        * Struggle toward a goal = implies challenge (ideally just the right amount)
        * Endogenous meaning = internally generated ie has meaning within the game context (Monopoly money)
    * **Lens #7: The Lens of Endogenous Value**
        * Think about players' feels about items, objects and scoring.
            * What is valuable to players, how can I make it more valuable?
            * What's the relation between value in the game and players' motivations?
    * Costikyan's definition add another 3 qualities for games:
        * They're interactive.
        * They have challenge.
        * They create interval value.
    * Another definition: "A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict and resolves in an unequal outcome" -Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, and Steven Hoffman
        * More items to add to the list"
            * Games engage players
            * Games are closed, formal systems
                * Another way of saying the game has clearly defined rules and boundaries.
    * Another approach to trying to define games: think about how people relate to games.
        * Most people play games because they like solving problems.
		* When problem solving is removed from a game, it ceases to be a game and is just an activity.
    * One possible definition: "A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude."
    * **Lens #8: The Lens of Problem Solving**
        * What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
        * Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
        * How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?
* Review:
	* "Fun is pleasure with surprises."
	* "Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity."
	* "A toy is an object you play with."
	* "A good toy is an object that is fun to play with."
	* "A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude."
* Reading:
	* [[Man, Play and Games]] by Roger Callois - 1961 that's a favorite of academics, containing insights about the nature of gameplay.
	* [[Finish and Infinite Games]] by James P. Carse - philosophical statement about the relationship between games and life.
	* [[Why We Play Games: Four Keys to Emotion without Story]] by Nicole Lazzaro - exploration of dimensions of fun.
	* [[Rules of Play]] by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, Chapters 7 and 8 contain some very thoughtful consideration of the definition of a game.
	* [[The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia]] by Bernard Suits - thought-provoking philosophical examination of nature of games.

* Key takeaways
    * Though this chapter doesn't contain any practice wisdom, spending the time to clearly define things can help develop insights. Though personally, I didn't gain a lot from this chapter.

## Five: The Game Comprises of Elements 
* The Four Basic Elements of a Game
    1. **Mechanics**
        * Rules/goals/limitations etc of the game.
            * More linear experiences, like film and books don't have mechanics, though may have other elements.
    2. **Story**
        * The events that happen in the game: " linear and prescripted, or it may be branching and emergent"
    3. **Aesthetics**
        * Has the most direct relationship to players' excperience.
    4. **Technology**
        * Choose of technology enables and prohibits certain things.
    * Each element supports the other: none are more important than the other.

    ![[elemental-tetrad.png]]

* **Lens #9: The Lens of Elemental Tetrad
	* Is my game design using all four elements?
	* Can I enhance elements from some of the categories?
	* Are the elements working together nicely?
* Space invaders example:
	* Technology: the game was made possible due to a custom motherboard made for it.
	* Mechanics: interesting and well balanced. Aliens further away are worth more points. The more aliens you destory, the faster they get builing excitment.
	* Story: simple but effective alien invasion that supports all elements.
	* Aesthetics: 3 different alien designs. Wit hcolour achieved by gluing translucent plastic to the screen. Marching invaders made a heartbeat noise as they sped up.
	* Each element works together but also makes comprimes for the other.
* Don't want to fall into the trap of thinking only about the inner working of the game and not the player experience.
* Holographic design: thinking about the elements of the game that make the experience possible.
* **Len #10: The Lens of Holographic Design**
	* What elements make the game fun?
	* What elements detract?
	* Can game elements be changed to improve the experience?

## Six: The Elements Support a Theme
* Use unifying theme strengthen game's experience.
	* Choose theme then reinforce at every opportunity
* **Lens #11: The Lens of Unification** #lens 
	* What is my theme?
	* Am I using every possible means possible to reinforce that theme?
* Choose themes that deeply resonate with players: freedom, love.
* Truth-based themes can resonate equally as well as experienced based.
	* Titanic example:
		* One of the themes of the movie is how tragic the Titanic accident was.
		* Though the tragedy of Titanic appeared to be main theme, the underlying was: “love is more important than life and stronger than death.”
	* Stephen King's Carrie:
		* Exploration of the meaning of blood: from injury, to family ties, to coming of age and used it to tune and strengthen the story.
	* Risk Legacy:
		* Game mechanics change game permanently (modify board with irremovable stickers, write on board with permanent markers, destroy game cards), reinforces theme: “war changes a world.”
	* Toontown Online:
		* The battle of play vs work.
* **Lens #12: The Lens of Resonance** #lens
	* What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
	* When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them excited?
	* If I had no constraints, what would the game be like?
	* I have certain instincts about the game. What is driving those instincts?
* Not all great games need a deeply resonant theme, but most can be strengthen by a unifying theme.
* Players appreciate unifying themes on an unconscious level:
    * "Players know they like a game, but they can’t quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interest- ing or important to them. " -pg 66
* Reading:
    * [[The Plenitude]] by [[Rich Gold]]. Theming is just one of the many topics in this treasure trove of wisdom by the designer of the Nintendo Power Glove.*
* Key takeaway:
    * Games with unified themes, that ideally deeply resonate with players, are the best kinds of games.

## Seven: The Game Begins with an Idea
* Inspiration for games can come from anywhere - not just other games.
* **Lens #13: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration** #lens 
    * What is an experience I've had that I'd like to share with others?
    * How can I capture that experience in a game?
* Design is problem solving.
* Before you start with solutions to the problem, start with a clear problem statement.
    * By stating the problem first, and not jumping to solutions, you give yourself a wider solution space to search. Why?
        * You may discover the problem has been artifically constrained.
        * You have a clear measurement of success.
        * It's easier to communicate your goals with the team.
    * Sometimes you learn more about the problem as you iterate - that's okay, go back and update the problem description.
* **Lens #14: The Lens of the Problem Statement** #lens 
    * Start by treating the game as a solution to a problem.
    * What is the problem I'm really trying to solve?
    * What assumptions have I made that don't have solve the problem?
    * Is the game truely the best solution? Why not?
    * How can I tell if the problem is solved?
* Use subconcious and sleep to your advantage:
    * Pay attention to your subconcious, even if it seems ridiculous.
    * Record your ideas.
    * Sleep well and be otherwise healthy.
    * Allow time to solve problems.
* Brainstorming tips:
    * Write down every solution that comes to you - refine them later.
    * Sketch, use toys etc - anything that helps the creative process.
    * Change your environment.
    * Immerse yourself in the problem - talk to other people, play similar games etc.
    * Index cards on the wall - Agile style.
    * Make a list of your assumptions and challenge them.
    * Brainstorm in categories for the elemental tetrad and mix and match.
    * Find a partner, but be wearly of brainstorming in big groups. Usually better to brainstorm in small groups then combine ideas in a larger group.

    * [[Groupthink: The Brainstorming Myth]] by [[Jonah Lehrer]]
    * [[Catching the Big Fish] by [[David Lynch]]
* Key takeways:
    * Seek inspiration outside of games for the types of experiences you want to shar with your players.
    * Start with a clear problem statement for your game and expect to iterate on the problem statement as you learn more.
    
## Eight: The Game Improves Through Iteration
* Don't get stuck with decision paralysis, pick an idea and commit to it quickly.
	* Through commiting to an idea, you start to give it full attention and discover weaknesses and strengths you could otherwise miss.
* **Lens 15: Law of Eight Filters** #lens 
    * Game should pass through 8 filters:
        * Does it feel "right" to you and your team?
        * Are the intended audience likely to like it?
        * Is it well designed - does it stand up to examiation through many lenses?
        * Is the game innovative?
        * Can the game become profitable?
        * Does the game meet my community and social goals?
        * Do playtesters enjoy the game?
* Rule of loop: the more times you test and improve, the better the game will be.
  * Ideally game can be iterated on quickly, but if not, innovation is require to figure out how to prototype it.
  	* How can I make every loop count?
    * How can I loop fast?
* [[Winston Royce]] wrote the paper that was the foundation for Waterfall, though didn't use the word and actually advocated for iterative development.
* [[Barry Boehm]] in 1986 presented the spiral model of software development:
	* Create basic design.
    * Assess risks in design.
    * Build prototypes to mitigate risks.
    * Test prototypes.
    * Create more detailed dsesigns based on what you learn.
* Agile Manifesto fleshed out the ideas in the spiral model: key part of it in risk management.
**Lens #16: The Lens of Risk Management** #lens 
  * What could keep the game from being great and how can we stop that from happening?
      * We generally want to work on parts of the game we're confident in but you have to face up to the parts in danger.
* Tips for Productive Prototyping:
    * Answer a question: what can my graphics engine handle? Will core gameplay be fun? Do characters and setting fit?
    * Forget quality: aim to answer questions quickly.
    * Plan to throw a lot of the prototype away.
    * Prioritise prototypes and consider dependance - does one prototype need to happen before another?
    * Parrallelise prototypes: can the software team be testing the engine while design tries UX?
    * Prototypes can be done on paper.
    * Prototypes don't have to be interactive - sketches and animations can answer questions.
    * Choose a fast game engine for prototyping (and ideally building)
    * Build a toy first - make sure the core gameplay is fun.
        * **Lens #17: The Lens of the Toy** #lens 
            * If my game had no goals, would it still be fun?
            * When people see my game, do they instantly want to play and interact with it?
    * Always be looking for opportunities for more loops - porting to another platform could be opportunity to fix parts of game that didn't work.
* "50% rule" for budgetting
	* Plan game development so that if 50% of budget were lost, the game was still in a releasable state. Once the game is working, spend the rest of the budget making it great.
        * Develops usually apply a 80/20 wrong, forgetting that things often go wrong, eating up the 20% time.
* **Lens #18: The Lens of Passion** #lens 
    * At the end of prototyping, as well as risk assessment, check how you feel about game 
    	* Am I passionate about how great game can be or can I be?
* Reading:
	* [[Sketching User Experiences]] by [[Billl Buxton]]
    * [[Have Paper, Will Prototype]] by [[Bill Lucas]]
    * [[The Kodold Guide to Board Game Design]] by [[Mike Selinker]]
    * [[Less Talk, More Rock]] by [[Superbrothers]]
    * [[Agile Software Developer]] on Wikipedia
    * [[The 4Fs of Game Design: Fail Faster, and Follow the Fun]] by [[Jason Vandenberghe]]
* Key takeaways:
      * Game design requires a lot of prototyping. You cannot be sure of the limitations of your designs until you do a lot of prototyping.
      * Prototyping can help answer the question about the true problem you're trying to solve.
      * 50% rule: plan game development so that if 50% of your budget were removed, you'd still have a shippable game. Then use the rest to make it great.

## Nine: The Game Is Made for a Player
* Good designs find way to project themselves into the minds of players.
* When creating something aimed at large groups of players, we consider ways we can group people aka [[demographics]].
* Game industry usually breaks players of ages down as follows:
    * 0-3 - infant / toddler
        * Interested in toys.
        * No complexity and problem solving skills.
        * Can be fascinated with direct interfaces like touch screens.
    * 4-6 - preschooler
        * Show first interest in games.
        * Simple games played with parents who are willing to bend the rules to keep kids engaged.
    * 7-9 - kids
        * The "age of reasoning"
        * Usually can read and solve harder problems.
        * Beginning to develop own interests separate from parents.
    * 10-13 - preteen or "tween"
    	* starting to consider things more deeply and with more nuance.
    	* can be passionate about interests: "age of obsession"
        * boys at this age in particular often become obsessed with games.
    * 13-18 - teen
        * getting ready for adulthood.
        * can be significant divergence between male and female interests here.
            * Boys = competition and mastery, girls = real-world issues and communication.
        * Teens often interested in experimenting with new kinds of experiences.
    * 18-24 - young adult
        * Less experimentation - have clearer tastes.
        * Often have time and money, hence becoming big consumers of games.
    * 25-35 - twenties and thirties
        * Age of "peak family formation"
        * More responsibilities of adulthood and less time for games.
        * Usually casual but also "hard core gamers" where games a primary hobby.
    * 35-50 - thirties and forties
        * "family maturation"
        * caught up in career and adult responsibilities.
        * want gameplay experiences for the whole family.
    * 50+ - fifties and up
        * "empty nesters"
        * sometimes returning to games they enjoyed when young.
        * games with strong social components: golf, tennis, bridge, online multiplayer games, Facebook games etc.
* All play activities are connected to childhood, since childhood is centered around play. To create games for someone of a particular age, you must be in tune with the games and themes that were popular when they were children.
* Gender differences show up sharply in purchasing preferences of games.
* [[Raph Koster]] in [[Theory of Run]] suggests the core of winning games is mastering abstract formal systems, which is generally preferred by males to females.
	* However, that is not the only gameplay experience available: story, creativity, learning and socialisation are experiences enjoyed by females.
* 5 things males like in games:
    * Mastery - even if not important or useful. Females prefer skills with interesting purpose
    * Competition
    * Destruction
    * Spatial puzzles
    * Trial and error
* 5 things females like in games:
    * Emotion-based
    * Real world
    * Nurturing
    * Dialog and verbal puzzles
    * Learning by example - prefer clear tutorials
* **Lens #19: The Lens of The Players** #lens 
    * Questions to ask about your players:
        * What do they like?
        * What don't they like?
        * What would they expect to see in a game?
        * If I were in their place, what would I want to see?
        * What would they like a dislike about the game?
* "Psycographics" is about grouping people by interests instead of how they look including lifestyle choices and the things they enjoy
* [[Marc LeBlanc]] list of 8 primary game pleasures:
    * Sensation
        * Delivered through game aesthetics
        * Usually about the "pleasure of the toy"
        * Can't make a bad game good, but can make a good game great.
    * Fantasy
        * Imaging yourself as something you're not
    * Narrative
        * Watching the story unfold
    * Challenge
        * Problem solving and mastery
    * Fellowship
        * Community and cooperation
    * Discovery
        * Exploration of games world or features or game strategy
    * Expression
        * Building characters and levels
        * Designing outfits

## Chapter 19: Stories and Games Take Place in Worlds

* Transmedia worlds
	* Star Wars toys were popular because they provide "another gateway into that world": kids could write their own Star Wars stories.
	* Pokemon another strong example: the TV show and card game reflected the intricate rules of the gameplay closely: "multiple media as gateways into a single, well-defined world"
	* Can be long-lived: see James Bond, Disney etc.
	* They can evolved over time: Sherlock Holmes did not originally start out as character with cap and pipe, that was made popular in play by William Gillette.
* **Lens #83: Lens of Fantasy**
	* What fantasy does my world fulfill? What does the player fantasize about being and doing?
* Properties of successful transmedia world's:
	* Are rooted and strongest in one medium: Pokemon in the gameboy game, Sherlock Holmes in the novel etc.
	* Intuitive: rules of the world are consistent.
	* Can tell many stories.
	* They make sense through any gateway.
	* Fulfill a "deep and important" wish.
* **Lens #84: The Lens of the World**
	* How is my world better than the real world?
	* Can their be multiple gateways that support each other?
	* Is the world centered on a single story, or can many stories happen?
* Huge part of what makes them interesting is who lives there: the characters.

## Chapter 20: Worlds Contain Characters

Topics: [[game characters]]
* Great stories contain memorable characters.
*  Patterns:
	*  Mental -> Physical
		* "Characters are defined by their media"
			* Characters in movies are involved in emotional and physical struggles.
			* Characters in games are entirely phyiscal, since the player does the thinking for them.
		* Reality -> fantasy
			* Novels are usually reality based, movies rooetd in reality with fantasy aspect and game entirely fantasy.
		* Complex -> simple
			* Complexity of plots and depth of charaters diminishes moving from novel to games.
	* Avatars
		* Used by a player to project themselves into the world.
		* Avatar choice can be a player's ideal form: heroic warrior, beautfiul princess etc.
		* Can be blank slate: a basic face that a person can project themselves onto: Mario, masked superheros etc.
	* **Lens #85: Lens of the Avatar**
		* Is my avatar an ideal form to resonate with player?
		* Does avatar have iconic qualities that let player project themselves unto character?
	* Tip #1 for compelling chars: List character functions:
		* Hero: character who plays the game.
		* Mentor: gives advice and useful items.
		* Assistant: gives tips.
		* Tutor: explains how to play game.
		* Final boss: someone to have the last battle against.
		* Minions: bad guys
		* Three bosses: tough guys to battle against.
		* Hostage: someone to resuce.
		* Match characters to functions: useful to seperate functions from vision of characters.
	* **Lens #86: Lens of Character Function**
		* What are the roles characters need to fill?
		* What characters have I already imagined?
		* Which character map well to which roles?
		* Can any characters fill more than one role?
		* Do I need to change the characters to better fit the roles?
		* Do I need any new characters?
	* Tip #2: define and use character traits
		* Create a "small, distilled list of traits that encapsulate the character".
			* Sabu: trustworthy, short tempoered, valiant, a fiery lover.
			* Lester: arrogant, sarcastic, spiritual, impulsive.
		* If your character is sneaky, does it show in their jump animation?
		* Should a depressed character walk and never run?
	* **Lens #87: Lens of Character Traits**
		* What traits define the character?
		* How do traits manifest themselves in appearance, words and actions?
	* Tip #3: Use interpersonal circumplex
		* Graph to visualise the relationships between characers
	 		![[_media/relationship-between-characters.png]]
		* Example from Star Wars:
			* With Han Solo in the middle, shows how characters relate to him
			![[_media/relationship-to-character.png]]
	* **Lens #88: Lens of the Interpersonal Circumplex**
	* Put character in the middle, and plot hostile/friendly and dominant / submission toward character - help to understand interpersonal dynamics.
	* Are there any extreme characters on the graph? Should there be?
	* Are character's friends in the same quandrant or diff?
	* Tip #4: Make character web
		* **Very useful tip**
		* What do characters think of all the other characters?
		* Success of TV Shows like Lost and Simpsons come from deep character webs.
	* **Len #87: Lens of Character Web**
		* How do each characters feel about other characters?
		* Are there other connections unaccounted for? Can I use them?
		* Are there similiar connections? Can they be more different?
	* Tip #5: Use status
		* Low-status behaviour: fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, touch one's own face and being tense.
		* High-status behaviour: relaxed and in control, making good eye contact, not moving your head while you spaek.
		* Book recommendation [Improv by Keith Johnstone](https://www.amazon.com.au/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone-ebook/dp/B00AC26KUU)
		* Because it's subconcious, character designers don't think to put status postures in.
		* **Lens #88: Lens of Status**
			* To do.
