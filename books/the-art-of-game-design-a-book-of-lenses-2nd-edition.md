Author: [[Jesse Schell]]
Type: #book
Topics: [[game design]]

## One: In the Beginning, There is the Designer
* You only become a game designer by designing games.
* Skills a game designer may use: animation, antropology, architecture, brain storming, business, cinematography, communcation, creative writing, economics, engineering, games, history, management, mathematics, music, psychology, public speaking, sound design, technical writing, visual arts.
	* Though no one can master all the skills, the more you can learn about each the better.
* The most important skill: listening
* 5 major categories: team, audience, game, client and self.
* Reading to consider:
	* [[Cirque de Soleil: The Spark-Igniting the Creative Fire that Lives within Us All]] - book about finding your path.
	* [[Challenges for Game Designers by Brenda Brathwaite and Ian Schreiber]] - a collection of exercises for stretching game design muscles.
* Key takeaway
    * Anyone can become a game designer but it's a skill that requires a lot of diversity of knowledge and the ability to listen and empathise.

## Two: The Designer Creates an Experience
* Goal of game designer is to create a compelling experience for the players.
* "The game is not the experience. The game enables the experience, but it _is not the experience_".
* Game designs have to deal with more interaction than designers of other mediums (ie movies).
* 3 fields that have sought to understand "mysteries of human mind and the secrets of the human heart": psychology, anthropology and design.
* Psychology
	* Behaviorists: focus on measurable behavior
	* Phenomenologists: focus on the nature of human experience and "feeling of what happens"
	* Game designers can make use of both behavioristic experiments and "phenomenological introspection:.
* Anthropology
	* Takes more holistic approach than psycology: looks at physical, mental and cultural aspects of people.
	* Cultural anthroplogists = immerse in studies world, including living with them.
	* Take a cultural anthropological approach to players: interviews, putting ourselves in their places to gain insights that would otherwise not be possible.
* Design
	* Designers seldom publish papers about their findinings.
	* Designers in a field often know little about designers in other fields.
	* Anyone who creates something for others to experience we can learn something from.
* We need to get knowledge from a range of sources, no single field has all the answers we need.
* Introspection: Powers, Peils and Practice
	*  "act of examining your own thoughts and feelings"
	*  two main perils of using introspections:
		*  Peril #1: introspection can lead to false conclusions about reality
			*  not so important to game designers, which are concerned with "feels like true" rather than what is true.
		*  Peril #2: what is true of my experiences may not be true for others
			*  Two extreme approaches to deal with this:
				*  only make games for people like me (ie only trust intuition)
					*  may not be a large enough audience for your unique tastes.
				*  only trust play testing (use no intuition only facts)
					*  some decisions need to be made before there's a game to play test
			* Observe your own experiences, then those of others to see how your experiences differ
	* Dissect your feelings
		* Must be able to analyse how you feel when you play a game.
		* Practice analysing your experience will help find the experiences you want to create from your game.
	* **Lens #1: the Lens of Emotion** #lens
		* What emotions should my players experince?
		* What emotions are they having now? Why?
		* How can I bridge the gap between emotions I want and what they're having?
	* Defeating Heisenberg
		* Heisenberg uncertainty principle from quantum mechancs: "motion of particle can't be observed without distubing the motion of that partical"
		* How can you observe your enjoyment of an experience without tainting that enjoyment?
			* Analyse memories:
				* Technique: engage in experience with intention to not analyze while you play, but immediately afterwards.
					* Requires practice.
			* Two passes:
				* Play once just experiencing.
				* Play again and take notes as you go.
			* Sneak glances:
				* With practice, can sneak glances while experience is happening.
					* Don't get carried away with analysis.
			* Observe silently:
				* It is possible with practice to silently observe your experience without interrupting it.
				* Can practice while watching TV, working etc.
				* Akin to mindfulness meditation: aware of your own autopilot without taking over.
		* Essential experience
			* Games only need the "essence of an experience", not the actual experience.
				* Game designer goal to find the essential experiences.
	* **Lens #2: The Lens of Essential Experience** #lens
		* What experience should the player have?
		* What's essential to it?
		* How can I capture it?
	* Being clear about the essential experience can give you a clearer picture of how to improve the game.
* Key takeaway
    * A game provides the essences of an experience - not the experience itself. Find the experience your game should provide, then the essence of that experience.

## Three: The Experience Takes Place In A Venue

* Mediums come and go but the venues that we consume them in persist.
* Private venues
    * The Hearth
        * People have a evolutionary connection to fire which is why homes have always had fireplaces.
        * The TV screen has replaced the fire in modern lives, and games based around it continue to be popular: Wii Sports, SingStar, Dance Central etc.
    * The Workbench
        * A private place in the house for hard problems.
        * Messy, usually not visited by guests.
        * Where the PC tends to go.
        * Games for here are played in solitude, or with likeminded people online.
        * Usually more difficult and intense.
    * The Reading Nook
        * Reading is usually done in a quiet place away from hearth and workbench.
        * Ipad gaming is a good fit for the reading nook.
* Public venues
    * What venue it is, be sure the experience is something you can't get at home.
    * The Theater
        * Place where large numbers of people experience something together.
        * Few games have made it in the theatre - maybe one day?
    * The Arena
        * Games where the results are public.
        * Some games played on the workbench are set in arena.
        * Few examples of digital games being played in traditional areas - yet...
    * The Museum
        * Including zoos and aquariums as types of museum's, they provide a chance to see the exotic and learn something about our world.
        * Museums are introducing gameplay elements to introduce visitors to information.
* Half Private / Half Public Venues
    * Venues that live in the boundary between privacy of home and openness of public.
    * The Gaming Table
        * Tabletop games, arcade machines, pool tables at bar.
        * Non-digital games are the mainstay of the gaming table, but perhaps touch screens could facilite the introduction of digital games here.
    * The Playground
        * Anywhere improvisational play happens.
        * Children largely play this way as part of their development.
        * Video game industry has largely ignored it but more mobile tech may change that.
* Anywhere
    * Crossword puzzles, sudoku, word find etc.
    * Mobile games.
    * Tend to be playable in "bite sized" chunks.
    * Players tend to prefer them to be free.
* Venues Mixed and Matched
    * Lots of gaps and overlaps with venues: bowling alleys, pinball at a restaurant etc.
    * Important thing is to see past the games and platforms to the venues and their properties.
* **Lens #3: Lens of the Venue** #lens 
	* What venue best suits game i'm creating?
	* Does venue have special properties that will influence the game?
	* What elements are in harmony with game? What elements aren't?
* Reading:
	* [[A Pattern of Language]] by Christopher Alexander et al - book about relationships between humans and spaces.
* Takeaways
    * Understanding what venue your game is designed for, allows you to see past technology and trends to understand your games key properties.

## Four: The Experience Rise Out of a Game
* We want to design experiences, but we cannot do it directly, it's done through a game.
* How can we define "game"?
    * People have slightly different definitions of what a "game" is.
    * Academics view lack of standardised definitions around game design a crisis.
* What Is A Game?
    * Surprise and fun are integral part of game experiences.
    * **Lens #4: The Lens of Surprise** #lens 
        * What will surprise players when they play the game?
        * Does the story have interesting surprises? Do the game rules? Does the artwork? The technology?
        * Do your rules give players way to surprise each other?
        * Do rules give players way to surprise themselves?
    * **Lens #5: Lens of Fun** #lens 
        * What parts of my game are fun?
        * What parts need to be more fun?
    * A possible definition for fun: "Fun is pleasure with surprises"
    * A possible definition for play: "Play is manipluation that indules curiosity."
    * **Lens #6: The Lens of Curiosity**
        * Consider player's true motivation, not just goals the game defines:
            * What questions does the game create for the player?
            * Can I create more questions for the player?
        * Example: maze-finding game with a time limit: "can I find my way through maze in 30 seconds"
        * Another question: "What will happen in the story after I complete this level?"
    * One possible definition of a game: "Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems, in which there is a contest between powers, confinded by rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome" - Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith
        * Leads to some key qualities of games:
            * Games are entered willfully.
            * Games have goals.
            * Games have conflict.
            * Games have rules.
            * Games can be won and lost.
    * Another possible definition: "(A game is) an  interactive structure of endogenous meaning that requires players struggle toward a goal" - Greg Costikyan
        * Interactive structure = player is active.
        * Struggle toward a goal = implies challenge (ideally just the right amount)
        * Endogenous meaning = internally generated ie has meaning within the game context (Monopoly money)
    * **Lens #7: The Lens of Endogenous Value**
        * Think about players' feels about items, objects and scoring.
            * What is valuable to players, how can I make it more valuable?
            * What's the relation between value in the game and players' motivations?
    * Costikyan's definition add another 3 qualities for games:
        * They're interactive.
        * They have challenge.
        * They create interval value.
    * Another definition: "A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict and resolves in an unequal outcome" -Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, and Steven Hoffman
        * More items to add to the list"
            * Games engage players
            * Games are closed, formal systems
                * Another way of saying the game has clearly defined rules and boundaries.
    * Another approach to trying to define games: think about how people relate to games.
        * Most people play games because they like solving problems.
		* When problem solving is removed from a game, it ceases to be a game and is just an activity.
    * One possible definition: "A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude."
    * **Lens #8: The Lens of Problem Solving**
        * What problems does my game ask the player to solve?
        * Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?
        * How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?
* Review:
	* "Fun is pleasure with surprises."
	* "Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity."
	* "A toy is an object you play with."
	* "A good toy is an object that is fun to play with."
	* "A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude."
* Reading:
	* [[Man, Play and Games]] by Roger Callois - 1961 that's a favorite of academics, containing insights about the nature of gameplay.
	* [[Finish and Infinite Games]] by James P. Carse - philosophical statement about the relationship between games and life.
	* [[Why We Play Games: Four Keys to Emotion without Story]] by Nicole Lazzaro - exploration of dimensions of fun.
	* [[Rules of Play]] by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, Chapters 7 and 8 contain some very thoughtful consideration of the definition of a game.
	* [[The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia]] by Bernard Suits - thought-provoking philosophical examination of nature of games.

* Key takeaways
    * Though this chapter doesn't contain any practice wisdom, spending the time to clearly define things can help develop insights. Though personally, I didn't gain a lot from this chapter.

## Five: The Game Comprises of Elements 
* The Four Basic Elements of a Game
    1. **Mechanics**
        * Rules/goals/limitations etc of the game.
            * More linear experiences, like film and books don't have mechanics, though may have other elements.
    2. **Story**
        * The events that happen in the game: " linear and prescripted, or it may be branching and emergent"
    3. **Aesthetics**
        * Has the most direct relationship to players' excperience.
    4. **Technology**
        * Choose of technology enables and prohibits certain things.
    * Each element supports the other: none are more important than the other.

    ![[elemental-tetrad.png]]

* **Lens #9: The Lens of Elemental Tetrad
	* Is my game design using all four elements?
	* Can I enhance elements from some of the categories?
	* Are the elements working together nicely?
* Space invaders example:
	* Technology: the game was made possible due to a custom motherboard made for it.
	* Mechanics: interesting and well balanced. Aliens further away are worth more points. The more aliens you destory, the faster they get builing excitment.
	* Story: simple but effective alien invasion that supports all elements.
	* Aesthetics: 3 different alien designs. Wit hcolour achieved by gluing translucent plastic to the screen. Marching invaders made a heartbeat noise as they sped up.
	* Each element works together but also makes comprimes for the other.
* Don't want to fall into the trap of thinking only about the inner working of the game and not the player experience.
* Holographic design: thinking about the elements of the game that make the experience possible.
* **Len #10: The Lens of Holographic Design**
	* What elements make the game fun?
	* What elements detract?
	* Can game elements be changed to improve the experience?

## Six: The Elements Support a Theme
* Use unifying theme strengthen game's experience.
	* Choose theme then reinforce at every opportunity
* **Lens #11: The Lens of Unification** #lens 
	* What is my theme?
	* Am I using every possible means possible to reinforce that theme?
* Choose themes that deeply resonate with players: freedom, love.
* Truth-based themes can resonate equally as well as experienced based.
	* Titanic example:
		* One of the themes of the movie is how tragic the Titanic accident was.
		* Though the tragedy of Titanic appeared to be main theme, the underlying was: “love is more important than life and stronger than death.”
	* Stephen King's Carrie:
		* Exploration of the meaning of blood: from injury, to family ties, to coming of age and used it to tune and strengthen the story.
	* Risk Legacy:
		* Game mechanics change game permanently (modify board with irremovable stickers, write on board with permanent markers, destroy game cards), reinforces theme: “war changes a world.”
	* Toontown Online:
		* The battle of play vs work.
* **Lens #12: The Lens of Resonance** #lens
	* What is it about my game that feels powerful and special?
	* When I describe my game to people, what ideas get them excited?
	* If I had no constraints, what would the game be like?
	* I have certain instincts about the game. What is driving those instincts?
* Not all great games need a deeply resonant theme, but most can be strengthen by a unifying theme.
* Players appreciate unifying themes on an unconscious level:
    * "Players know they like a game, but they can’t quite say why. Often, the reason is that all of the elements are reinforcing a theme that is interest- ing or important to them. " -pg 66
* Reading:
    * [[The Plenitude]] by [[Rich Gold]]. Theming is just one of the many topics in this treasure trove of wisdom by the designer of the Nintendo Power Glove.*
* Key takeaway:
    * Games with unified themes, that ideally deeply resonate with players, are the best kinds of games.

## Seven: The Game Begins with an Idea
* Inspiration for games can come from anywhere - not just other games.
* **Lens #13: The Lens of Infinite Inspiration** #lens 
    * What is an experience I've had that I'd like to share with others?
    * How can I capture that experience in a game?
* Design is problem solving.
* Before you start with solutions to the problem, start with a clear problem statement.
    * By stating the problem first, and not jumping to solutions, you give yourself a wider solution space to search. Why?
        * You may discover the problem has been artifically constrained.
        * You have a clear measurement of success.
        * It's easier to communicate your goals with the team.
    * Sometimes you learn more about the problem as you iterate - that's okay, go back and update the problem description.
* **Lens #14: The Lens of the Problem Statement** #lens 
    * Start by treating the game as a solution to a problem.
    * What is the problem I'm really trying to solve?
    * What assumptions have I made that don't have solve the problem?
    * Is the game truely the best solution? Why not?
    * How can I tell if the problem is solved?
* Use subconcious and sleep to your advantage:
    * Pay attention to your subconcious, even if it seems ridiculous.
    * Record your ideas.
    * Sleep well and be otherwise healthy.
    * Allow time to solve problems.
* Brainstorming tips:
    * Write down every solution that comes to you - refine them later.
    * Sketch, use toys etc - anything that helps the creative process.
    * Change your environment.
    * Immerse yourself in the problem - talk to other people, play similar games etc.
    * Index cards on the wall - Agile style.
    * Make a list of your assumptions and challenge them.
    * Brainstorm in categories for the elemental tetrad and mix and match.
    * Find a partner, but be wearly of brainstorming in big groups. Usually better to brainstorm in small groups then combine ideas in a larger group.

    * [[Groupthink: The Brainstorming Myth]] by [[Jonah Lehrer]]
    * [[Catching the Big Fish] by [[David Lynch]]
* Key takeways:
    * Seek inspiration outside of games for the types of experiences you want to shar with your players.
    * Start with a clear problem statement for your game and expect to iterate on the problem statement as you learn more.
    
## Eight: The Game Improves Through Iteration
* Don't get stuck with decision paralysis, pick an idea and commit to it quickly.
	* Through commiting to an idea, you start to give it full attention and discover weaknesses and strengths you could otherwise miss.
* **Lens 15: Law of Eight Filters** #lens 
    * Game should pass through 8 filters:
        * Does it feel "right" to you and your team?
        * Are the intended audience likely to like it?
        * Is it well designed - does it stand up to examiation through many lenses?
        * Is the game innovative?
        * Can the game become profitable?
        * Does the game meet my community and social goals?
        * Do playtesters enjoy the game?
* Rule of loop: the more times you test and improve, the better the game will be.
  * Ideally game can be iterated on quickly, but if not, innovation is require to figure out how to prototype it.
  	* How can I make every loop count?
    * How can I loop fast?
* [[Winston Royce]] wrote the paper that was the foundation for Waterfall, though didn't use the word and actually advocated for iterative development.
* [[Barry Boehm]] in 1986 presented the spiral model of software development:
	* Create basic design.
    * Assess risks in design.
    * Build prototypes to mitigate risks.
    * Test prototypes.
    * Create more detailed dsesigns based on what you learn.
* Agile Manifesto fleshed out the ideas in the spiral model: key part of it in risk management.
**Lens #16: The Lens of Risk Management** #lens 
  * What could keep the game from being great and how can we stop that from happening?
      * We generally want to work on parts of the game we're confident in but you have to face up to the parts in danger.
* Tips for Productive Prototyping:
    * Answer a question: what can my graphics engine handle? Will core gameplay be fun? Do characters and setting fit?
    * Forget quality: aim to answer questions quickly.
    * Plan to throw a lot of the prototype away.
    * Prioritise prototypes and consider dependance - does one prototype need to happen before another?
    * Parrallelise prototypes: can the software team be testing the engine while design tries UX?
    * Prototypes can be done on paper.
    * Prototypes don't have to be interactive - sketches and animations can answer questions.
    * Choose a fast game engine for prototyping (and ideally building)
    * Build a toy first - make sure the core gameplay is fun.
        * **Lens #17: The Lens of the Toy** #lens 
            * If my game had no goals, would it still be fun?
            * When people see my game, do they instantly want to play and interact with it?
    * Always be looking for opportunities for more loops - porting to another platform could be opportunity to fix parts of game that didn't work.
* "50% rule" for budgetting
	* Plan game development so that if 50% of budget were lost, the game was still in a releasable state. Once the game is working, spend the rest of the budget making it great.
        * Develops usually apply a 80/20 wrong, forgetting that things often go wrong, eating up the 20% time.
* **Lens #18: The Lens of Passion** #lens 
    * At the end of prototyping, as well as risk assessment, check how you feel about game 
    	* Am I passionate about how great game can be or can I be?
* Reading:
	* [[Sketching User Experiences]] by [[Billl Buxton]]
    * [[Have Paper, Will Prototype]] by [[Bill Lucas]]
    * [[The Kodold Guide to Board Game Design]] by [[Mike Selinker]]
    * [[Less Talk, More Rock]] by [[Superbrothers]]
    * [[Agile Software Developer]] on Wikipedia
    * [[The 4Fs of Game Design: Fail Faster, and Follow the Fun]] by [[Jason Vandenberghe]]
* Key takeaways:
      * Game design requires a lot of prototyping. You cannot be sure of the limitations of your designs until you do a lot of prototyping.
      * Prototyping can help answer the question about the true problem you're trying to solve.
      * 50% rule: plan game development so that if 50% of your budget were removed, you'd still have a shippable game. Then use the rest to make it great.

## Nine: The Game Is Made for a Player
* Good designs find way to project themselves into the minds of players.
* When creating something aimed at large groups of players, we consider ways we can group people aka [[demographics]].
* Game industry usually breaks players of ages down as follows:
    * 0-3 - infant / toddler
        * Interested in toys.
        * No complexity and problem solving skills.
        * Can be fascinated with direct interfaces like touch screens.
    * 4-6 - preschooler
        * Show first interest in games.
        * Simple games played with parents who are willing to bend the rules to keep kids engaged.
    * 7-9 - kids
        * The "age of reasoning"
        * Usually can read and solve harder problems.
        * Beginning to develop own interests separate from parents.
    * 10-13 - preteen or "tween"
    	* starting to consider things more deeply and with more nuance.
    	* can be passionate about interests: "age of obsession"
        * boys at this age in particular often become obsessed with games.
    * 13-18 - teen
        * getting ready for adulthood.
        * can be significant divergence between male and female interests here.
            * Boys = competition and mastery, girls = real-world issues and communication.
        * Teens often interested in experimenting with new kinds of experiences.
    * 18-24 - young adult
        * Less experimentation - have clearer tastes.
        * Often have time and money, hence becoming big consumers of games.
    * 25-35 - twenties and thirties
        * Age of "peak family formation"
        * More responsibilities of adulthood and less time for games.
        * Usually casual but also "hard core gamers" where games a primary hobby.
    * 35-50 - thirties and forties
        * "family maturation"
        * caught up in career and adult responsibilities.
        * want gameplay experiences for the whole family.
    * 50+ - fifties and up
        * "empty nesters"
        * sometimes returning to games they enjoyed when young.
        * games with strong social components: golf, tennis, bridge, online multiplayer games, Facebook games etc.
* All play activities are connected to childhood, since childhood is centered around play. To create games for someone of a particular age, you must be in tune with the games and themes that were popular when they were children.
* Gender differences show up sharply in purchasing preferences of games.
* [[Raph Koster]] in [[Theory of Run]] suggests the core of winning games is mastering abstract formal systems, which is generally preferred by males to females.
	* However, that is not the only gameplay experience available: story, creativity, learning and socialisation are experiences enjoyed by females.
* 5 things males like in games:
    * Mastery - even if not important or useful. Females prefer skills with interesting purpose
    * Competition
    * Destruction
    * Spatial puzzles
    * Trial and error
* 5 things females like in games:
    * Emotion-based
    * Real world
    * Nurturing
    * Dialog and verbal puzzles
    * Learning by example - prefer clear tutorials
* **Lens #19: The Lens of The Players** #lens 
    * Questions to ask about your players:
        * What do they like?
        * What don't they like?
        * What would they expect to see in a game?
        * If I were in their place, what would I want to see?
        * What would they like a dislike about the game?
* "Psycographics" is about grouping people by interests instead of how they look including lifestyle choices and the things they enjoy
* [[Marc LeBlanc]] list of 8 primary game pleasures:
    * Sensation
        * Delivered through game aesthetics
        * Usually about the "pleasure of the toy"
        * Can't make a bad game good, but can make a good game great.
    * Fantasy
        * Imaging yourself as something you're not
    * Narrative
        * Watching the story unfold
    * Challenge
        * Problem solving and mastery
    * Fellowship
        * Community and cooperation
    * Discovery
        * Exploration of games world or features or game strategy
    * Expression
        * Building characters and levels
        * Designing outfits
    * Submission
        * Submitting to game world
        * Good games make suspending disbelief effortless
* Taxonomy of player types by [[Richard Bartle]]
    * Achievers - want to achieve goals of the game
    * Explorers - want to discover and explore breadth of game 
    * Socialities - pleasure of fellowship
    * Killers - competing with and defeating others and "impressing themselves on others" which could also include helping others
    * Graph shows that achievers are interested in acting on the world, explorers interacting with the world, socializers in interacting with players and killers interesed in acting on players:
        ![Bartel's graph of player type space](../_media/bartles-player-space.png)
* Other pleasures to consider:
    * Anticipation
    * Completion
    * Delight in other's misfortune - schadenfreude
    * Gift giving and making others happy
    * Humor
    * Possibility - having many choices and knowning you can pick any of them
    * Pride in an accomplishment
    * Surprise
    * Thrill - "fear minus death equals fun"
    * Triumph over adversity - Italian word for it: "fiero"
    * Wonder - awe & amazement
* **Lens #20: The Lens of Pleasure** #lens 
    * Questions:
        * What pleasures does my game give to players? Can they be improved?
        * What pleasures are missing?
    * Go through list of known pleasures and consider how well it's delivered.
* Reading:
    * [[Designing Virtual Worlds]] by [[Richard R. Bartle]] 
    * [[Pleasures of the Brain]] by [[Morten L. Kringelbach]] and [[Kent C. Berridge]]
 * Key takeaway:
 	* Understanding the key demographics and their interests is important, but equally import is thinking about the types of things that give your players pleasure.
    
## Ten: The Experience Is in the Player's Mind

* The are 4 main mental abilities that are used when playing games: modelling, focus, imagination and empathy.
* Modelling
    * Our brains don't consume reality directly instead a simplified model of it.
    * Example:
        * Colours are just light wavelengths that our brains registers as being distinctly different through colours.
        * We can look at a cartoon of a human and immediately understand it's a person even though it's lacking many details.
    * Games are a "predigested model" of reality explaining why they're relaxing to play: the complexity has already been stripped away.
    * By understanding the "reality illusion" you can make experiences feel as real (or even more real) than reality itself.
* Focus
    * Our brains have the capacity to focus attention selectively.
        * Example:
            * "Cocktail party effect" - can drown out noise of lots of conversations and focus on just one.
    * [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] wrote about flow: "a feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfillment"
    * Key components necessary to create flow state for player:
        * Clear goals
            * If goals are unclear, we aren't sure whether our current action is useful.
        * No distractions
            * Want to engage both mind and hands
                * Menial labour causes the mind to wander
                * Sitting and thinking causes us to fidget
        * Direct feedback
            * Feedback should be directly after an action, so they know if they're closer to goal.
        * Continuously challenging
            * "flow activities must manage to stay in the narrow margin of challenge that lies between boredom and frustration"
            * Ideal game has a cycle of "tense and release" where the play experience follows a track like this:
                * ![Optimal challenges to skill for flow](../_media/optimal-challenges-to-skill-for-flow.png)
    * **Lens #21: The Lens of Flow**
        * Does my game have clear goals?
        * Are the goals of the player the same goals I intended?
        * Is there places in the game that distract the player to the point they forget their goal?
        * Does the game provide the right level of challenge for the player?
        * The the player's skills improving at the rate I hoped?
* Empathy
    * Humans have a strong ability to feel the feelings of others (or at least our model of others)
    * Cinematographers use this knowledge to great effect
    * If games are about problem solving, empathic projection is one method of problem solving: imagine myself in the place of another to make decisions for them
* Imagination
    * Imagination is an important human skill for problem solving and "filling in the details"
    * It's also used for communication - ie story telling.

## Eleven: The Player's Mind is Driven By The Player's Motivation
 * All entertainment is the idea to make something unimportant seem important: they do this using motivation.
 * Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
     * Represented as a pyramid.
     * Idea is that lower levels need to be achieved before tackling higher levels of need.
     * ![Maslows' Hierarchy of Needs](../_media/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs.png)
     * Most games fulfill achievement and mastery needs, so even higher levels.
 * More needs
     * [[Edward Deci]] and [[Richard Ryan]] developed self-determination theory
     * Suggest we have 3 core needs:
         * **Competance** - being good at something
         * **Autonomy** - ability to do things your way
         * **Relatedness** - need to connect to others
     * Games are good at fulfilling all these needs.
 * **Lens #22: The Lens of Need**
     * Which level of Maslow's hierarchy is my game operating?
     * Does it fill needs of competence, autonomy and relatedness?
     * Can game fill more basic needs than it already does? Can it fulfill the ones it does better?
 * Even games need to fulfill human needs: if people imagine that game is going to make them feel better about themselves or connect with their friends, they'll want to play it.
 
 * Intrinstic vs Extrinsic motivation
     * Core idea is that intrinsic is stuff you do for fun, extrinsic is stuff others motivate you to do (ie for payment)
     * Reality, most activities don't fit neatly into one category or other but on a spectrum.
     * ![Extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation](../_media/extrinsic-vs-intrinsic-motivation.png)
* Wanna vs Hafta
    * Many gameplaying motivations are about pleasure seeking: collecting stars, getting combos etc; many are centered on pain avoidance: avoiding enemies, trying not to die.
    * Free to play games often start out as pleasure seeking, then eventually pain avoidance: not keeping daily streak etc.
* **Lens #24: The Lens of Motivation** #lens
    * What motivations do players have to play my game?
    * What motivations are most internal? Which are external?
    * What are pleasure seeking? What are pain avoiding?
    * What motivations support each other?
    * Which motivations are in conflict?
* Novelty
    * Games are always keen for a "new" experience, but they won't hang around if there isn't substance as well as novelty.
    * **Lens #25: The Lens of Novelty** #lens
        * What is novel about my game?
        * Does my game have novelties throughout or just at the beginning?
        * Do I have the right mix of novel and familiar?
        * When the novelty wears off, is my game still fun?
* Judgement
    * We have a need to know how we stack up compared to others.
    * **Lens #26: The Lens of Judgement** #lens
        * What does your game judge about your players?
        * How does it communicate this judgement?
        * Do players feel the judgement is fair?
        * Do they care about the judgement?
        * Does the judgement make them want to improve?
* Reading
    * [[Glued to Games]] by [[Scott Rigby]] and [[Richard M. Ryan]] an insightful guide to the relationship between self-determination theory and what makes games work.
    * [[Punished by Rewards]] by [[Alfie Kohn]]. This book is an excellent overview of the vast body of research about the downsides of extrinsic rewards.
    * [[Understanding Motivation and Emotion]] by [[Johnmarshall Reeve]] -college-level textbook about the world of psychological research on the subject.
    
## Twelve: Some Elements Are Game Mechanics

* Skeleton of the game, when aesthetics have been stripped away is the Game Mechanics.
* Though no universally agreed upon taxonomy for Game Mechanics exists, author breaks them down into seven main categories.
* Mechanic 1: Space
    * Generally:
        * Are discrete or continuous
        * Have some number of dimensions
        * Have bounded areas that may or may not be connected
    * Tic Tac Toe example
        * Grid is 3x3 (discrete)
        * Each circles is a 0d place.
        * Adjacency is meaningful.
    * Monopoly example
        * Grid is discrete
        * 1d space
        * Connected by loop
    * Useful to break game down into bare functional space so you aren't distracted by aesthetics
    * Sometimes useful to consider parts of game in 2d or 3d
        * Soccer example
            * 2d and continuous for understanding and modifying boundaries
            * 3d for modifying height of goals or changing rules are how high player can kick
            * 2d and discrete to consider strategy, defence, player placement et.
    * Nested spaces
        * Spaces within spaces is common: consider map world that can be freely explored that takes you to less free levels.
    * Zero dimensions
        * 20 questions could be considered zero dimensions
        * Still useful to imagine as a 1d space with a graph between question and answerer: `{Answerer's mind} -> {Conversation space} -> {Questioner's mind}`
    * **Lens #26: The Lens of Functional Space**
        * Is the game discrete or continuous?
        * How many dimensions?
        * What are the boundaries?
        * Are there subspaces? How are they connected?
        * Is there more than one useful way to abstractly model the space?
    * "If you can simultaneously see your abstract functional space and the aesthetic space the player will experience, as well as how they interrelate, you can make confident decisions about the shape of your game’s world."
* Mechanic #2: Time
    * Games can have discrete or continuous time
    * Word for unit of discrete time is "turn" aka turn-based games.
    * Clocks and Races
        * Used in many games to set absolute time limits for things
        * Can be nested: basketball has round timer and shot clock to keep game interesting
    * Controlling Time
        * Can stop or pause time ala "time outs" in sports.
        * Speed up time: Civilisation.
        * Rewind time: when you die and start level again or from checkpoint.
        * Games like Braid even make time a central mechanic.
    * **Lens #27: The Lens of Time**
        * Experiences can be spoiled when too long, too short, too fast or too slow
        * What determines the length of gameplay activities?
        * Are players frustrated that game is too short? Or bored that it's too long?
        * Would the game be better without time limits?
        * What hierarchy of time structure help game?
* Mechanic #3: Objects, Attributes and States
    * Objects are nouns of game, attributes are adjective.
    * Objects generally have one or more attributes including the position within the world.
        * Some attributes rarely change, ie max speed of car.
        * Some attributes are very dynamic: current speed of car.
    * Some state changes are supposed to be hidden from players, others should be as clear as possible
        * Rule of thumb: if things act the same, they should look the same.
    * Games have many states and attributes and it's easy for designer to get confused:
        * Useful to construct a state diagram for each attribute and to understand state changes and connections.
    * **Lens #28: The Lens of The State Machine** #lens 
        * What are the objects in the game?
        * What are attributes of each object?
        * What are the possible states?
        * What triggers state changes of each attribute?
    * Secrets	
        * In most boardgames, all information is public
        * In card games, hidden/private state is a key part of the game
        * In video games, there's also information that only the AI is aware of and also stuff that only game is aware of.
        * Small changes to who knows what information can radically change a game: great way to create drama is to make piece of private information suddenly public.
        * **Lens #29: The Lens of Secrets** #lens 	
            * What is known to the game only?
            * What is known by all players?
            * What is known by some or only one player?
            * Would changing who knows what information improve my game in someway?
* Mechanic #4: Actions
    * Actions are verbs of games: what can players do?
    * Two perspectives on actions:
        * First kind of action is *basic action*
            * Run, walk, sit etc
        * Second kind is *strategic action*
            * How can players use basic actions to achieve a goal?
    * Emergent gameplay
        * Strategic actions are actions that aren't usually part of the rules but emerge during gameplay.
        * Ratio of strategic actions to basic actions is a good indication of how much emergent behaviour the game has.
        * 5 things to add emergent gameplay:
            * More verbs / basic actions
                * Though too many that don't have good interactions can create a bloated / confusing game.
            * Verbs that act on many object
                * Instead of using a gun to shoot bad guys, can it shoot locks off doors / windows?
            * Goals that can be achieved multiple ways
                * Ie guns that can shoot at enemies or can shoot down chandeliers which kill enemies.
                * This does make game harder to balance and can result in one path being the main path players take.
            * Many subjects
                * If checkers had just two pieces: a red and black one, it'd be a lot less interesting.
                * The interaction of many pieces is what makes checkers interesting.
            * Side effects that change constraints
                * When a piece in checkers is moved, the opponents available moves are limited.
        * **Lens #30: The Lens of Emergence**
            * How many verbs do players have?
            * How many objects can each verb act on?
            * How many ways can players achieve goals?
            * How many subjects do players control?
            * How do side effects change constraints?
    * Lots of games appear to be derivatives because they share the same action. Innovative games usually introduce new actions either basic or strategic.
    * **Lens #31: The Lens of Action**
        * What are the basic actions of the game?
        * What are the strategic actions?
        * Am I happy with ratio of basic to strategic actions?
        * What actions do players want to do that they can't?
        * Deciding on actions is most fundamental decision designers can make.
* Mechanic #5: Rules
    * David Parlett's game rule diagram
        * ![David Parlett's Game Rule Diagram.png](../_media/david-parletts-game-rule-diagram.png)
        * Operational rules
            * Most basic: what do players do to play the game?
            * Understanding required for players to play the game.
        * Foundational rules
            * Abstract / formal version of rules: operation might be "the player should role a 6-sided die and get that many chips", foundational: "the players power value is increased by random value from 1 to 6"
            * Mathematical representation of game state, though there is no standard notation for game state.
        * Behavioural rules
            * Implicit / unwritten rules.
            * "Don't tickle the other player while they're choosing a move in chess."
        * Written rules
            * Document that players read in order to learn rules.
            * Falling out of favour in video games, in favor of teaching them through play.
        * Laws
            * Developed when game enters serious / high-stakes settings.
            * Tekken 5 (a fighting game)at the 2005 Penny Arcade Expo:
                * a. Single elimination.
                * b. You may bring your own controller.
                * c. Standard VS mode.
                * d. 100% health.
                * e. Random stage select.
                * f. 60 second timer.
                * g. best 3 of 5 rounds.
                * h. best 2 of 3 games.
                * i. Mokujin is banned
            * Official rules
                * Laws that merge with written rules to become offical.
                    * Saying "check" when opponent is at risk of checkmate.
            * Advisory rules
                * Rules pertaining to strategy; stuff that helps you play better.
    * Modes
        * The mini/sub games within games ie playing yoga in GTA 5.
        * Rules of play can change completely.
        * Too many modes and game can get confusing.
            * Sid Meier rule of thumb: "players shouldn't spend so long in the subgame that they forget the main game they were playing"
    * Enforcer
        * In traditional games, rules are enforced by other players or if stakes are high, referees.
        * Digital games can be enforced by computer and become a constraint in the world.
    * Cheatability
        * If players feel like game can be cheated (even if not), some will cheat, most will no longer want to play.
    * Most Important Rule
        * The object of the game is the most important rule.
        * Should be able to state the game's objective clearly: "capture your opponents King"
        * Rules for good game objectives:
            * Concrete - players understand and can state what they're doing.
            * Achievable - players must think they can achieve the goal.
            * Rewarding - players should feel rewarded and proud of their achievement.
        * Must balance short-term and long-term goals.
            * Players should know what to do next and what they're ultimately working towards.
        * Lens #32: Lens of Goals
            * What is the ultimate goal of my game?
            * Is the goal clear to players?
            * Is there a series of goals that are understood by players?
            * Are different goals related to each other in a meaningful way?
            * Are goals accurate, achievable and rewarding?
            * Balance of short and long term goals?
            * Can players decide on their own goals?
        * Good idea to pick up Lens of Toy, Lens of Curiosity and Lens of Goals at the same time.
    * Game is not just defined by it's rules, it is its rules.
    * **Lens #33: The Lens of Rules** #lens 
        * What are the foundational rules of the game? How are they different from operational rules?
        * Are there "laws" or "house rules" that should be incorporated into formal rules.
        * Are there different modes? Would game be better with more modes? Fewer modes?
        * Who enforces the rules?
        * Are rules easy to understand?
    * Make notes while playtesting about holes in rules that appear - be weary of just patching them up as the same holes will appear again elsewhere.
* Mechanic #6: Skill
    * Players skill level should be a good match to game's difficulty to stay in flow channel.
    * Games usually require a blend of skills:
        * Physical skills
            * Common in most sports.
            * Controller manipulation is one sort of physical skill.
        * Mental skills
            * Memory, observation, puzzle solving. Games that require no mental skills are rare.
            * Games are interesting when there are decisions to make.
        * Social skills
            * Reading/fooling opponent (Poker)
            * Communicating (Overcooked)
    * Real vs Virtual Skills
        * Virtual skills: skills achiquired in game that are seperate to player's skill (ie sword upgrade).
        * Virtual skills can give player a feeling of power but too many and the game will feel hollow.
    * **Lens #34: The Lens of Skills**
        * What skill does my game require?
        * Are their categories of skill the game is misisng?
        * What skills are dominant?
        * Are these skills creating experiences I  want?
        * Are some players better than others?
        * Can players improve their skill with practice?
        * Does the game demand the level of skill?
    * Lens of skill works hand-in-hand with lens of essential experience.
* Mechanic #7: Chance
    * Ten rules of probability
        * Rule #1: Fractions are decimals are percentages
            * 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
            * Per cent = per 100
        * Rule #2: Probabilities are between 0 and 1
            * You cannot have a negative probability nor greater than 1.
            * 0 = definitely won't happen, 1 = definitely will happen.
        * Rule #3: Probability is simply "the outcomes you're looking for" / "all possible outcomes"
            * Ie probability of getting red = 26 red cards / 52 total cards = 26 / 52 = 0.5
        * Rule #4: Enumeration will solve any probability problem if you have enough time
            * If you want to know probablity of flipping coin 3 times and getting heads at least twice, you can enumerate all possibilities of 3 flips:
                * HHH --
                * HHT --
                * HTT
                * HTH -- 
                * THH --
                * THT
                * TTH
                * TTT
            * 4/8 = 50%
        * Rule #5: If outcomes are mutually exclusive, OR means  add the probability
            * For example, if you are getting the probability of drawing a face card OR an ace, since they're mutually exclusive they can be added:
                * 12/52 + 4/52 = 16/52
        * Rule #6: If outcomes are mutually exclusive, AND means multiple
            * Probability of getting a Diamond and an Ace? Since they are not mutually exclusive, you must multiple the probablility
                * 13/52 * 4/52 = 52/2704 = 1/52 (correct: there is only one Ace of Diamonds)
        * Rule #7: 1 - the probability of something happening = the probabilty of it not happening
            * If an event has a 10% chance, the probability of it not happening is 90%
        * Rule #8: The sum of multiple linear random selection is not a linear random selection
            * Linear random selection = random event with each outcome having a equal chance of winning (ie a dice roll)
            * If you sum the results of 2 dice roles, you will end up with a normal probability distribution.
        * Rule #9: Practical probabilty should get closer to theoritical probabilty with more samples
            * Theoretical probability = I expect to roll a 6 with a probabiity of 1/6 (16.6%)
            * Practical probabilty = I roll a dice 100 times and 20 times it rolled a 6 (20%)
            * Determinig probability using simulators is referred to as the Monte Carlo method.
        * Rule #10: Ask questions to math experts
    * Expected value
        * Average of all possiilible values that can result from an action.
            * Dice roll example: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 3.5
        * Expected value is a good tool for game balancing
            * Example, balaincg a fantasy role-playing game:
                * Wind attack - 100% prob of hitting with 4 damage = 4 expected value
                * Fire ball - 80% chance with 5 damange = 4 expected value
                * Lightning bolt = 20% change with 40 damage = 8 expected value
            * If you have an enemy with 500 hitpoints, it makes sense to use the lightning bolt, but 15? It may make sense to use wind attack.
        * Human element of expected value
            * If players weren't told the prob of lighting bolt attack and missed 3 times, they may assume it has a 0% chance of hitting.
            * Even with perfect information, players won't necessarily choose option with highest EV
                * Psychologists [[Kahneman and Tversky]] ask subjects which game they want to play:
                    * Game A: 66% chance of winning $2400, 33% chance of winning $2500 and 1% chance of $0 (EV = $2409)
                    * Game B: 100% chance of winning $2400 (EV = $2400)
                * Only 18% picked A, even though it was better than B.
                * Why? People seek out options that create the most pleasure and avoid pain
                * Not only are people will to pay a price to avoid regret, they are willing to take risks.
                * "When it comes to taking risks for gains, people are conservative. They will make a sure gain over a problem gain. But we are also finding that when people are faced with a choice between a small, certain loss and a large probable loss, they will gamble."
            * Game designs must understand actual and perceived probablities when calculating expected values.
        * **Lens #35: The Lens of Expected Value** #lens    
            * What is the actual chance of an event occuring?
            * What is the perceived chance?
            * What valeu of the outcome of that even have? Are there other aspects of the value not considered?
            * Am I happy with expected values of possible outcomes? Do they make the game interesting?
        * Skills and chance
            * Estimating chance is a skill: ie blackjack players do card counting to try to estimate the next card.
            * Skills have a probabilty of success: even skill-based games like baseball, actions like stealing basis has some level of risk.
            * Estimating an opponents skill is a skill
            * Predicting pure chance is an imagined skill.
            * Controlliung pure chance is an imagined skill (ie superstitious rituals)
        * **Lens #36: The Lens of Chance** #lens   
            * What in my game is truly random? What parts feel random?
            * Does randomness give players positive feelings of excitment and challenge? Or negative feelings of hoplessness and lack of control?
            * Would changing my probability distribution curves improve my game?
            * Do players have opportunity to take interesting risks in the game?
            * What's the relationship between chance and skill in the game? Can random elements feel like exercise of a skill?
        * Risk and randomess can add spice to game, but too much can overwhelm everything else.

## Thirteen: Game Mechanics Must Be In Balance

* Balance: adjusting elements of game until you get the experience you want.
* 12 most common types of game balance:
    * Balance Type #1: Fairness
        * Symmetrical games
            * Equal resources are given to all players.
            * Sports and traditional board games (Monopoly, chess etc) use this method.
            * Advantages like who goes first can be sorted with random selection or giving advantage to player with the least skill: "youngest goes first".
        * Asymmetrical Games
            * Equals resources are not given to all players.
            * Lots of balancing required for these games.
            * Why?
                * Simulate real-world situations (ie warfare).
                * Allows players to explore game space (ie can learn about all strengths/weaknesses of fighters in a fighting game.)
                * Personalisation: make players feel powerful in shaping the game space.
                * Level the playing field for inexperienced players (ie golf handicaps)
                * To create interesting situaionts: players can find optimal combinations and can determine themselves if game is balanced.
        * Strategies for balancing
            * Assign a value to each resource then use expected value to determine if balanced (eg plane 1 speed = 1, firepower = 2, plane 2 speed = 2, firepower = 3).
            * Making mathematical models like this requires careful playtesting.
                * Rule of thumb for game balancing: half of development should be spent balancing.
            * Make sure each thing in the game has something else that has an advantage over it: see rock, paper, scissors.
        * **Lens #37: Lens of Fairness** #lens
            * Should my game be symmetrical or asymetrical?
            * Is it more important that game is a reliable measure of who has most skill or should it provide an interesting challenge to all players?
            * If players with different skills player together, what do I use to make it more interesting and challenging for everyone?
    * Balance Type #2: Challenge vs Success
        * Finding right balance between challenge and success is key to keeping player in flow state.
        * Common techniques:
            * Increase difficulty with every success -> players build their skills until they can complete a level, then it's increased.
            * Let skilled players get through the easy parts first.
            * Layers of challenge: ie grade scores assigned to each level, extra bonuses that can be completed to "master" a level.
            * Players choose difficulty (ie easy, medium and hard settings).
            * Play test with a variety of players: don't fall into the trap of playtesting with only novices lest you make the game too easy, nor only experts lest you make the game too difficult.
            * Give the losers a more opportunity to reclaim ground. Mario Kart would give better power ups to players further behind to level the playing field.
        * Toughest challenge in game balancing: deciding how the difficulty should progress over time.
            * Learning to play a game at all is a challenge - make sure first levels of game are simplistic while they try to understand controls and goals.
        * **Lens #38: The Lens of Challenges** #lens
            * What are the challenges in my game?
            * Are they too easy, too hard, or just right?
            * Can my challenges accomodate a variety of skill levels?
            * How does the level of challenge increase as the player succeeds?
            * Is there enough variety in the challenges?
            * What's the maximum level of challenge in the game?
    * Balance Type #3: Meaningful Choices
        * Most designers fall into trap of offering meaningless choices: if you have 10 cars to choose from but they all drive the same, it's like no choice at all.
        * On the flip side, if you have 10 cars but 1 is clearly better it's also like no choice at all.
        * When you discover you have a "dominant strategy", you should work to correct it.
            * Hidden "dominant strategies" can also be referred to as exploits.
        * Consider how many meaningful choices to give to the player:
            * If choices > desires, player is overwhelmed.
            * If choices < desires, player is frustrated.
            * If choices = desires, player feels free and fulfilled.
        * Some games call for smaller choices other endless.
        * **Lens #39: The Lens of Meaningful Choices** #lens 
            * What choices am I asking the player to make?
            * Are they meaningful? How?
            * Are they getting the right number of choices?
            * Are there dominant strategies in the game?
        * Triangulation
            * Games that are fun have elements of high-risk / high-reward options.
                * Space invaders example: the space ship in space invaders. Gives a lot of points but risks losing focus on the aliens.
                * Mario Kart example:
                    * Pick manual or automatic cars.
                    * Kart or bike? Kart has faster base speed but bike can do a wheelie to go faster than karts.
                    * Grab power ups or ignore them?
                    * Use power ups or focus on race?
                    * Keep power up you've got or opt for something better?
                    * Use speed boost pads?
                    * Hit gas early at start line?
                    * Take shortcut or safer route?
    * Balance Type #4: Skill vs Chance
        * Some players prefer very little elements of chance, others a lot. Need to understand your player.
        *  "Key to addictive game design is designing your game such that players are doing three things at all times: exercising a skill, taking risks, and working a strategy"
        *  **Lens #41: The Lens of Skill vs Chance**
            *  Are my players here to be judged (skill) or take risks (chance)
            *  Skills are usually more serious than chance: is the game serious or casual?
            *  Are parts tedious? What elements of chance can enliven them?
            *  Are parts of my game too random?
    *  Balance Type #5: Head vs Hands
        * More thinking or more physical activites?
        * Understand what your target market prefers in a game.
        * **Lens #42: Lens of Head and Hands**
            * Are playing looking for physical or intellectual challenge?
            * Would solving puzzles make the game more interesting?
            * Are there places where player can relax the brain and play game without thinking?
            * Can I give the player a choice - succeed by thinking or with physical dexterity?
    * Balance Type #6: Competition vs Cooperation
        * Both popular style of games.
        * Team competition one way to get the best of both worlds.
        * **Lens #43: The Lens of Competition**
            * Does my game give fair measurement of player skill?
            * Do people want to win my game?
            * Is winning something people can be proud of?
            * Can novices compete in the game?
            * Can experts meaningfully compete?
            * Can experts generally be sure they will defeat novices?
        *  **Lens #44: The Lens of Cooperation**
            *  Can cooperating players communicate?
            *  Are players strangers? Do you need to break the ice?
            *  Do players all have the same role?
            * Does game have tasks players need to cooperate to complete?
            * Do any tasks force communication?
        * **Lens #45: The Lens of Competition vs. Cooperation**
            *  Do players want competition or cooperation or a mix?
            *  Does team competition make sense?
    * Balance Type #7: Game length
        * Balancing game length:
            * too long == players grow bored.
            * too short == not enouch chance to develop meaningful strategies.
    * Balance Type #8: Rewards
        * Games are "structures of judgement" and people want to be judged (ideally favorably).
        * Rewards tell your player they've done well.
        * Types of rewards:
            * Praise: Nintendo games famous for giving praise via animation and sound.
            * Points: sometimes gateways to other rewards, other times reward unto themselves (especially when public)
            * Prolonged Play: ie pinpall - allows for higher score and more rewards.
            * A gateway: reward is to open a new part of the game.
            * Spectable: animations / music etc - usually paired with other rewards.
            * Expression: clothes / decoration etcs. Give more ways for a player to express themselves.
            * Powers: becoming tall in Super Mario, better gun in shooter etc.
            * Resources: in Casinos real money, games virtual currency / items.
            * Status: leaderboard rankings, badges etc.
            * Completion: feeling of closure from completing all the challenges.
        * Games usually opt to combine rewards.
        * Rules of thumb from psychology:
            * Players acclimate to rewards quickly. Simple solution is to increase the value of rewards as the game progresses.
            * [[variable rewards]]: if every 1/3 monsters you defeat gives you bonus items, it's a lot more interesting than getting them consistently.
        * **Lens #46: Lens of Rewards**
            * What are the game's current rewards? Is there room for more?
            * Are players excited when they get rewards or bored?
            * Do players understand the rewards they're getting?
            * Are the rewards too regular? Should they be given out more variably.
            * How are my rewards related to one another?
            * How do rewards build? Too fast, too slow or just right?
    * Balance Type #9: Punishment
        * Reasons to punish players:
            * Creating endogenuous value. For example, resources will be worth more if there's a chance they can be taken.
            * Excitment: balancing rewards against punishments adds a sense of risk and makes success more rewarding.
            * Possible punishment increases challenge.
        * Common types of punishment:
            * Shaming - display "Missed" or "You lose" on screen.
            * Loss of points
            * Shortened play
            * Terminated play
            * Setbacks
            * Removal of powers
            * Resource depletion
        * Psychological studies show that rewards are better for reinforcement than punishment.
            * Diablo change their original food system from: you have to eat to survive (boring and tedious) to food gives you extra powers.
        * All punishment should be understood and preventable.
        * Random / unstoppable = "unfair" experience
        * **Lens #47: The Lens of Punishment**
            * What are the punishments in game?
            * Why am I punishing players?
            * Do they seem fair?
            * Could I turn punishments into rewards with same outcome?
            * Are strong punishments balanced against strong rewards?
     
## Chapter 19: Stories and Games Take Place in Worlds

* Transmedia worlds
	* Star Wars toys were popular because they provide "another gateway into that world": kids could write their own Star Wars stories.
	* Pokemon another strong example: the TV show and card game reflected the intricate rules of the gameplay closely: "multiple media as gateways into a single, well-defined world"
	* Can be long-lived: see James Bond, Disney etc.
	* They can evolved over time: Sherlock Holmes did not originally start out as character with cap and pipe, that was made popular in play by William Gillette.
* **Lens #83: Lens of Fantasy**
	* What fantasy does my world fulfill? What does the player fantasize about being and doing?
* Properties of successful transmedia world's:
	* Are rooted and strongest in one medium: Pokemon in the gameboy game, Sherlock Holmes in the novel etc.
	* Intuitive: rules of the world are consistent.
	* Can tell many stories.
	* They make sense through any gateway.
	* Fulfill a "deep and important" wish.
* **Lens #84: The Lens of the World**
	* How is my world better than the real world?
	* Can their be multiple gateways that support each other?
	* Is the world centered on a single story, or can many stories happen?
* Huge part of what makes them interesting is who lives there: the characters.

## Chapter 20: Worlds Contain Characters

Topics: [[game characters]]
* Great stories contain memorable characters.
*  Patterns:
	*  Mental -> Physical
		* "Characters are defined by their media"
			* Characters in movies are involved in emotional and physical struggles.
			* Characters in games are entirely phyiscal, since the player does the thinking for them.
		* Reality -> fantasy
			* Novels are usually reality based, movies rooetd in reality with fantasy aspect and game entirely fantasy.
		* Complex -> simple
			* Complexity of plots and depth of charaters diminishes moving from novel to games.
	* Avatars
		* Used by a player to project themselves into the world.
		* Avatar choice can be a player's ideal form: heroic warrior, beautfiul princess etc.
		* Can be blank slate: a basic face that a person can project themselves onto: Mario, masked superheros etc.
	* **Lens #85: Lens of the Avatar**
		* Is my avatar an ideal form to resonate with player?
		* Does avatar have iconic qualities that let player project themselves unto character?
	* Tip #1 for compelling chars: List character functions:
		* Hero: character who plays the game.
		* Mentor: gives advice and useful items.
		* Assistant: gives tips.
		* Tutor: explains how to play game.
		* Final boss: someone to have the last battle against.
		* Minions: bad guys
		* Three bosses: tough guys to battle against.
		* Hostage: someone to resuce.
		* Match characters to functions: useful to seperate functions from vision of characters.
	* **Lens #86: Lens of Character Function**
		* What are the roles characters need to fill?
		* What characters have I already imagined?
		* Which character map well to which roles?
		* Can any characters fill more than one role?
		* Do I need to change the characters to better fit the roles?
		* Do I need any new characters?
	* Tip #2: define and use character traits
		* Create a "small, distilled list of traits that encapsulate the character".
			* Sabu: trustworthy, short tempoered, valiant, a fiery lover.
			* Lester: arrogant, sarcastic, spiritual, impulsive.
		* If your character is sneaky, does it show in their jump animation?
		* Should a depressed character walk and never run?
	* **Lens #87: Lens of Character Traits**
		* What traits define the character?
		* How do traits manifest themselves in appearance, words and actions?
	* Tip #3: Use interpersonal circumplex
		* Graph to visualise the relationships between characers
	 		![[_media/relationship-between-characters.png]]
		* Example from Star Wars:
			* With Han Solo in the middle, shows how characters relate to him
			![[_media/relationship-to-character.png]]
	* **Lens #88: Lens of the Interpersonal Circumplex**
	* Put character in the middle, and plot hostile/friendly and dominant / submission toward character - help to understand interpersonal dynamics.
	* Are there any extreme characters on the graph? Should there be?
	* Are character's friends in the same quandrant or diff?
	* Tip #4: Make character web
		* **Very useful tip**
		* What do characters think of all the other characters?
		* Success of TV Shows like Lost and Simpsons come from deep character webs.
	* **Len #87: Lens of Character Web**
		* How do each characters feel about other characters?
		* Are there other connections unaccounted for? Can I use them?
		* Are there similiar connections? Can they be more different?
	* Tip #5: Use status
		* Low-status behaviour: fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, touch one's own face and being tense.
		* High-status behaviour: relaxed and in control, making good eye contact, not moving your head while you spaek.
		* Book recommendation [Improv by Keith Johnstone](https://www.amazon.com.au/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone-ebook/dp/B00AC26KUU)
		* Because it's subconcious, character designers don't think to put status postures in.
		* **Lens #88: Lens of Status**
			* To do.
