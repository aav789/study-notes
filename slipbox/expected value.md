# Expected Value

In the book [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition|The Art of Game Design - A Book of Lenses (2nd Edition)]] in Chapter 12: Some Elements Are Game Mechanics, Schell describes expected value as the sum of those outcomes with a value assigned to them divided by total outcomes. For example, the expected value of a dice roll is: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +5 +6 ) / 6 = 3.5.
