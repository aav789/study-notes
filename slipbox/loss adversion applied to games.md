# Loss adversion (applied to games)
 In [[The Art of Game Design - A Book of Lenses (2nd Edition)#Twelve Some Elements Are Game Mechanics]], Schelll describes Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory as applied to games, in that players will be willing to pay a premium to avoid losses - they may take a lower [[Expected Value]] option if it means less chance of regret. Even more surprising, players will be willing to take risks to avoid losses. Think of a gambler who lost a little money, they may be willing to gamble more money to avoid a little regret. Further described in Wikipedia article on [Loss adversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion).
