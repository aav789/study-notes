Adding or subtracting 2 vectors is as simple as adding or subtracting the corresponding parts from each vector. 

$$ \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 + y_1 \\ u_2 + y_2 \end{bmatrix} $$
    
You can therefore only add 2 vectors that are the same size
 
Vector addition is represented visually by drawing the 1st vector, then drawing the 2nd vector starting from the tip of the 1st vector, then drawing a line from the tail of the 1st vector to the tip of the 2nd.
