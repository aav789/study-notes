One of the two methods of story telling in games. The game isn't designed with a specific story, but a unique one is generated each game. Combat sports are an example of this, where a story can be told about the battle between participants. The Sims and Minecraft are games that are specifically designed to be story machines.

The opposite of [[String of Pearls]] in which a linear, non-interactive story is followed by a player, interspersed with periods of free play.
