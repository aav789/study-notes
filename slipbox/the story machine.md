# The Story Machine

Described by [[Jesse Schell]] in [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition#Chapter 17 One Kind of Experience Is the Story]], as one of the two methods of story telling in games. The game isn't designed with a specific story, but a unique one is generated each game. Combat sports are an example of this, where a story can be told about the battle between participants. The Sims and Minecraft are games that are specifically designed to be story machines.

The opposite of [[string of pearls]] in which a linear, non-interactive story is followed by a player, interspersed with periods of free play.
