# Transmedia Worlds

Discussed by Schell in Chapter 19 of [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition]] and coined by Henry Jenkins, refers to a world that can be "entered" through many different types of media. Pokemon and Star Wars are great examples of this. Schell describes 6 traits that make for a successful transmedia world: a strong original media (ie Pokemon started out as a Gameboy game); intuitive; have a single creator or small team at its core; can tell many stories; and make sense through any gateway (Pokemon works as PC game, card game etc).
