# Interpersonal Circumplex

A tool described by Schell in [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition#Chapter 20 Worlds Contain Characters]] which was brought from the world of social psychology by Katherine Isbister, in which you draw a diagram with 2 axes: friendliness and dominance and place a character in the centre, then visualise their relationship to other characters. Useful for understanding character relationships within stories.
