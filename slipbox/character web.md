# Character Web

A tool described by Schell in [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition#Chapter 20 Worlds Contain Characters]] for creating strong characters within a story you write down what each character thinks of others. Example:

"""

Archie

* Veronica: archie is lured by her elegance and beauty. Though she is rich, archie doesn’t care much about that.
* Betty: archie’s true love, but her insecurity constantly gives him mixed signals, so he doesn’t pursue her as forcefully as he might.
* Reggie: archie shouldn’t trust Reggie, but he often does, because archie always tries to be a nice guy and archie is kind of gullible.
* Jughead: archie’s best friend. What they have in common is that they are both underdog

Related to [[interpersonal circumplex]] as another tool for building rich character relationships within a story.
