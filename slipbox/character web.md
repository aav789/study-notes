A tool for creating strong characters within a story. You write down what each character thinks of others. Example:

Archie

* Veronica: archie is lured by her elegance and beauty. Though she is rich, archie doesn’t care much about that.
* Betty: archie’s true love, but her insecurity constantly gives him mixed signals, so he doesn’t pursue her as forcefully as he might.
* Reggie: archie shouldn’t trust Reggie, but he often does, because archie always tries to be a nice guy and archie is kind of gullible.
* Jughead: archie’s best friend. What they have in common is that they are both underdog

Related to [[Interpersonal Circumplex]] as another tool for building rich character relationships within a story.
