# Indirect Control

The topic of Chapter 18 in [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition]], in which Schell decribes a list of ways a game designer can exert indirect control of the player through constraints, goals, visual interfaces, game characters; and sound and music. An important part of game design as it allows players to experience a feeling of freedom while still following the designers intended [[interest curves]].
