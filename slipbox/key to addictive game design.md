# Key to Addictive Game Design

In the [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition]], in the Balancing chapter on Skill vs Chance, Schell describes Designer David Perry's key to addictive games: games should be designed so that players are doing 3 things at a time: exercising a skill, taking risks and working a strategy.

Supercell's Clash Royale is a great example of mastery of this: you exercise skills firstly by learning whichs cards are strong and weak against each other, then where to place warriors and eventually selecting a strong team; the game presents numerous opportunties to task risks and there are many strategies that can be explored. 

This is related to Schell's idea about [[triangularity in game design]] importance of taking risks.
