# Emergent Complexity
Described in [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition|The Art of Game Design - A Book of Lenses (2nd Edition)]], in Chapter 13: Game Mechanics Must Be in Balance, it's the opposite of [[innate complexity]] (in which complex rules need to be learned in order to play) and a desired property of a game. Arises when you have a simple ruleset from which complex interations can arise.

Related to the idea of [[emergent gameplay]] in the context of strategy, another desired property of a game.
