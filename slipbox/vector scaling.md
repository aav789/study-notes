# Vector Scaling
Vector scaling is the process of multiplying each value in the vector by some amount (hence "scalar").
$$ 2 \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 * u_1 \\ 2 * u_2 \end{bmatrix}  $$
The amount you scale the vector is often referred to as the [[scalar]].
It can be visualised as growing or shrinking the arrow that represents the vector

The choice of how to think about the results of a scaled vector will be informed by the [[3 perspectives of vectors]].
