Hacker News commenter [jrockway](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jrockway) writes about his experience with promotions at Google that resonated with me:

*"The biggest problem I found with promotions is that people wanted one because they thought they were doing their current job well. That isn't promotion, that's calibration, and doing well in calibration certainly opens up good raise / bonus options. Promotion is something different -- it's interviewing for a brand new job, by proving you're already doing that job."*

Employees assume that the path to promotion is doing their current job well. However, promotion is about proving that you're capable of another job, usually by proving you're already doing parts of it.

This is in someways an extension of Charity Major's blog post [Know Your "One Job" and Do It First](https://charity.wtf/2021/03/07/know-your-one-job-and-do-it-first/). In her post she talks about knowing your "one job" and making sure you're doing that well first. For promotion, therefore, you should know your "one job" and also the one you have an ambition for.
