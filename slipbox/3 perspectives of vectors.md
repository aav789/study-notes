[[3Blue1Brown]] says that there are 3 different perspectives for understanding vectors:

* **Physicist**: they consider a vector to be an arrow pointing in space defined by  its length (called magnitude) and direction. This is often how students are first introduced to vectors in math classes.
        * Vectors from this perspective are written numerically by using the coordinates. In 2d space, the numbers should how far in the x-axis to travel and how far in the y-axis to draw the vector.
* **Computer scientist**: a vector is an ordered list of numbers. For example, you could represent a model of a house by its square footage and price: `house_vector = [$square_foot, $price_of_house]`
        * The numbers can be plotted on a coordinate system to see how they relate to each other.
* **Mathematician**: anything which has a notion of adding 2 vectors together and multiplying a vector by a number.
