# Meaningful Game Economies

Schell, in the book [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition]], says that a [[game economy]] is defined as simply: how players spend and earn money. He says a successful game economy has meaningful answers to those questions and usually that involves a loop: they spend money to allow them to earn more money. This patterns shows up in a lot of game design.

Related to [[meaningful choices in games]] and [[game design is problem solving]].
