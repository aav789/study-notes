A Voxel refers to a single datapoint in a 3d-grid, in the same way a [[Pixel]] refers to a datapoint on a 2d-grid. The word is a combination of "volume" and "pixel". 

The volume and data can be anything.

For example, the Terrain system in Roblox allow creators to fill a grid of 3x3x3 voxels with different material and also specify how full each voxel should be.

[This Roblox Script](https://gist.github.com/lextoumbourou/b1b29c27b69caf29cc2f9a2e04949734) creates a single voxel of water with 100% occupancy:
