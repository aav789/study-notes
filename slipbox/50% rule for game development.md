# 50% rule for game development

In [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition]] in Chapter 8, Schell says that you should plan game development so that if 50% of your budget were removed, you'd still have a shippable game. Then use the rest to make it great.

Later in the book in Chapter 13, he mentions that half the development time should be spent balancing the game. Balance is a clear part of what makes a game great.
