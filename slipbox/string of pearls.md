# String of Pearls

Described by [[Jesse Schell]] in [[the-art-of-game-design-a-book-of-lenses-2nd-edition#Chapter 17 One Kind of Experience Is the Story]], as one of the two methods of story telling in games. It involves a pre-scripted, linear story interupted by free play (challenges, puzzles etc). Notable examples are The Last of Us. Even games that have non-linear stories generally are just series of strings of pearls.

The opposite of [[the story machine]], which generates a unique story every game.
