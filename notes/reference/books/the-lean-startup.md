## Introduction

* Startups fail: [[Selection Bias]] and "after-the-fact rationalisation" have lead people believe that anyone can succeed
* The details "or boring" stuff are what matter most in startups.
"Entrepreneurship is a kind of management"
* IMVU:
    * Built an "terrible" MVP (buggy etc)
    * Gave to customers (and charged for it) before it's ready
    * Get feedback (but "did not do what they said")
    * Ship really fast
* Basis for Lean Startup:
    *  builds on business and product management ideas like [[Lean Manufacturing]], [[Design Thinking]], [[Customer Development]] and [[Agile Development]].
    * fast cycle time
    * focus on what customers want (without asking)
        * more likely to run experiments on customers than cater to their whims
    * scientific approach to making decisions
* Origins of Lean Startup
    * Author grew up programming.
    * Always worked in product development
    * Worked on hard products that failed.
    * His background lead him to try to fix with techical solutions that lead to more failure
    * Learned [[Customer Development]] methodology from Steve Blank:
            * business and marketing functions as important as engineering and product development and have equally rigurous methodology
    * Started using unorthodox methods that were working but not explainable.
    * Studied outside eng:
        * [[Lean Manufacturing]] originated in Japan with Toyota Production System
            * New way of thinking about manufacturing of physical goods
    * Evolved ito Learn Startup: lean thinking applied to innovation
        * About "eliminating waste": startups that built products nobody wants
        * For entrepreneurs and "those holding them accountable"
    * Learn Startup Method
        * Based on 5 principals:
            * Entrepreneurs are everywhere
                * According to definition of startup: "A human institution designed to create new products & service under extreme uncertainty"
            * Enterpreneurship is management
                * A startup is an institution, not just product.
                * Requires new style of leadership geared towards uncertainty
            * Validated learning
                * Startups exist to "learn how to build a sustainable business"
                * Validate scientifically by running frequent experiments
            * Build-Measure-Learn
                * Turn ideas into products
                * Measure customer response
                * Learn whether to pivot or persevere
            * Innovation accounting
                * Hold innovators accountable with "new kind of accounting":
                    * Measuring progress
                    * Setting up milestones
                    * Priorities work
* Why Startups Fail
    * Promise of a good plan and strategy through market research
        * Too much uncertainty in startups
        * Don't know who customers are - what product should be
        * Old management methods like planning and forecasting are accurate without long, stable operating history
    * The opposite also doesn't work: having no management and chaos
* Counter intutive to think startups can and must be managed be managed
    * Passion, energy, vision that people bring can't be wasted
* Book organisation:
    * 3 parts: Vision, Steer and Accelerate

        * About new kind of enterpreneurial management
        * Validated learning: use scientific experimentation to discover how to build business
    * Steer

        * Build MVP to test assumptions
        * Accounting system for evaluating progress
            * When to "pivot or persevere"?
    * Accelerate
        * Learn to work through Build-Measure-Learn fast
        * Lean manufacturing applied to startups, like "small batches"
