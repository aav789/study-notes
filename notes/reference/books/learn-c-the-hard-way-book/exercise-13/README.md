# Exercise 13: Switch Statement

* Switch statement in C is really a "jump table".
* Expressions must result in integers. Integers are then used to calculate "jumps" from top of ```switch``` to part that matches value.
* Unless you include a ```break``` expression, we'll fall through to next lines of code.
* Include a ```default``` for when things aren't matched
