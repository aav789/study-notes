# An Introduction To Asynchronous Programming and Twisted

## Part 1

* Synchronous model

* Threaded model:
	<img src="./images/threaded-model.png"></img>
* Async model
	<img src="./images/async-model.png"></img>

* Condition under which asynchronous model is faster - when particular task is waiting for a resource (ie blocking).
* Fundamental idea behind asynchronous model: "when faced with a task that would normally block...(it) will instead execute some other task that can still make progress"
* Async works best when:
    * Large number of tasks, so one should always be making progress
    * Tasks do heaps of I/O, causing sync program to block when it could otherwise be serving requests
    * Tasks are largely independant from each other (so little need for inter-task communication)

## Part 2

* Blocking client basically just waits until socket no 1 has finished sending data, then goes to no 2 and so on.
* Async client moves to the next socket each time there's a block, using:

```
try:
    new_data = sock.recv(1024)
except socket.error, e:
    if e.args[0] == errno.EWOULDBLOCK:
        # this error code means we would have
        # blocked if the socket was blocking.
        # instead we skip to the next socket
        break # Move to next socket
```

* Contrast with Go's model:
  * Non-blocking isn't really needed. It has "multiple threads of execution" so you can leave a thread blocked and do work in another.
* The use of a loop that waits for events to happen then acts on them called a "Reactor Pattern".
<img src="./images/reactor-pattern.png"></img>
  * Called "reactor" because it waits for and reacts to events.
  * Twisted is basically an implementation of the Reactor Pattern with extras.

### Exercises

2\. Could the asynchronous client provide a get_poetry function that returned the text of the poem? Why not?

No, because it doesn't know which server is going to finish returning data first.

3\. If you wanted a get_poetry function in the asynchronous client that was analogous to the synchronous version of get_poetry, how could it work? What arguments and return values might it have?

Basically, you could pass a dict of callback functions mapping the sock id to a function that was called once a single poem was downloaded.

## Part 3

* Reactor loop doesn't start until told to. You start by calling ```reactor.run()```
* Reactor loop runs in same thread as started in.
* Once loop starts, it doesn't stop until killed
* Reactor is a singleton
* Twisted contains multiple reactors. You need to install them before using them.

```
from twisted.reactor import pollreactor
pollreactor.install() # Need to 'install' reactors before using them

from twisted.internet import reactor
reactor.run()
```

* Properties of callbacks:
  * Callback code runs in same thread as Twisted loop
  * When callbacks are running, Twisted loop isn't
  * Vice versa
  * Reactor loop resumes when callbacks are done 
* Avoid making block calls in call backs.
  * Network I/O blocking is handled by Twisted out the box
  * Use Twisted API for stuff like ```os.system``` which is non-blocking
* Example of callLater(<call_time_in_seconds>, <method>)

```
class Countdown(object):
    counter = 5

    def count(self):
        if self.counter == 0:
            reactor.stop()
        else:
            print self.counter, '....'
            self.counter -= 1
            reactor.callLater(0.1, self.count)

reactor.callWhenRunning(Countdown().count)

print 'Start'
reactor.run()
print 'Stop!'
```

* Exceptions raised in a call back won't cause the app to die. It'll report it and continue.

### Exercises

* [3 independent counters example](./exercises/part_3/ex1.py)
* [LoopingClass example](./exercises/part_3/ex2.py)

## Part 4

* Interfaces: principle purpose is documentation.

* ```reactor.addReader(self)``` takes an object that much conform to an [interface](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/releases/twisted-8.2.0/twisted/internet/interfaces.py).

* The ```addReader``` method should take an an ```IReadDescriptor``` provider

### Exercises

* The first exercise basically just requires the prevention of the task calling ```reactor.addReader(self)``` when the socket connection fails eg: ```try / except socket.error```
* [Use callLater to make the client timeout](./exercises/part_4/ex2.py) 

## Part 5

* Twisted abstractions are usually defined by an interface, specifying how derives object should behave.
* Transports:
  * Defined by ```ITransport``` in main ```interfaces``` module.
  * A Transport is a single connection that can send or receive bytes (TCP, UDP, Unix pipes).
  * Generally use implementations that Twisted provide.
* Protocols
  * Implements a networking protocol like FTP or IMAP (or something you create)
* Protocol Factories
  * Creates instances of Protocol Factories
  * ```buildProtocol``` method should return a new Protocol instance when it's called
  * Primary Factory class is ```twisted.internet.protocol.Factory``` but will generally use a more specialised class
* Protocol construction
  * Step 1
    * In Protocol Factory, need to specify Protocol to build with the ```protocol``` class var.
    * Using ```buildProtocol``` method, we instantiat the protocol as above.
    * Protocol created with same factory can share state with parent factory
  * Step 2
    * Protocol connects with a Transport using the ```makeConnection``` method. Stores a ref to the transport object in the ```self.transport``` attribute
  * Step 3
    * Protocol can process incoming data with ```dataReceived```, which takes as input a sequence of bytes (aka a string)
    * ```self.transport.getPeer()``` returns information on the server data is coming from
  * [Example from memory](factory_and_client.py)

### Exercises

* [get poetry client with timeout](./exercises/part5/ex1.py)

## Part 6

* Can't mix synchronous code with async (obvious).
* Use ```Failure``` object for handling passing errors back instead of callbacks (even better -- another abstraction discussed in later Parts)

### Exercises

1. [Timeout Poem](notes/literature/tutorials/an-introduction-to-asynch-programming-and-twisted/exercises/part6/ex1.py)

## Part 7

* Consider that if errors aren't caught in async programs, program can become "stuck" waiting for callback that may never arrive
* ```Deferred``` class is designed to make dealing with callbacks easier
  * Defined in ```twisted.internet.defer```
  * Contains a chain of callbacks and errbacks
  * Will not let you fire the normal result callback twice
    ```
    d.addCallbacks(out, out)
    d.callback('First result')
    d.callback('Second result') # This will error with twisted.internet.defer.AlreadyCalledError
    ```
  * ```addBoth``` method is used to add same function to callback and errback handlers

## Part 8

* More about deferreds, contrasting synchronous programming returning actual results, with deferred returning something that'll fire later. Nothing new.

### Exercises

* [Exercise 1: Timeout if poem isn't received in time](part_8_ex_1.py)
* [Exercise 2: Print appropriate address on failure](part_8_ex_2.py)

## Part 9

* low-context code - code like `socket.connect()` that is for general purposes and knows nothing about the functions from which it came form
* high-context code - code like `main()` which knows all about the program and its purpose
* Deferred class has tools to help catch general errors that wasn't explicitely caught and send to `errBack`. When an exception is caught, it will automatically fire the next `errBack` in the deferred.
* Callbacks and errBacks are always registered in pairs:
   * `addCallbacks` - takes in two arguments a callBack and an errBack
   * `addCallback` - takes in 1 argument (plus arguments to pass into callBack). It adds an implicit pass-through `errback`, which just falls-through to next errback.
   * `addErrback` - same but with implicit `callBack`
   * `addBoth` - takes in 1 argument that's both a callback and errback

## Part 10: Poetry Transformed

* Callback chains
  * ```d.addCallback(do_something_that_could_error_or_succeed)``` - if it asserts, it will pass to next errback. Else, pass result to callback
  * ```d.addCallbacks(handle_success, handle_err)``` 
* On errBack, returning a value will be passed to the next callBack in the chain, and thus continue the callBack/errBack chain.  

## Part 11: Your Poetry is Served

* ```self.transport.write()``` - write data to connection.
* ```self.transport.loseConnection()``` - Close connections after writing all data.
* ```reactor.listenTCP``` method takes in an subclass instance of ```ServerFactory```,
* ```Factory``` -- builds a protocol and saves persistant configuration. Does not need to know about network at all.
* ```Protocol``` -- actually implements protocol handling.
* ```reactor.listenTCP(port, factory)``` - method for ensuring a factory listens on the wire.
  * Creates a "listening socket and adds it to the event loop"
  * Twisted will create a ```Transport``` via the ```Factory``` class, which transports data to the ```Protocol```

## Part 12: A Poetry Transformation Server

* Separate protocol logic from service logic is a common pattern.
  * Allows for providing the same service via multiple protocols.
  * Question: under what circumstance would you use the same service via multiple protocols?
* Smart to guard access to service through `xform` method prefix to prevent attackers from running arbitrary methods.

### Exercises

1. If client sends a malformed netstring, q ``NetstringParseError`` is raised, causing the ``self.transport.loseConnection()`` method to be called, dropping the connection.
