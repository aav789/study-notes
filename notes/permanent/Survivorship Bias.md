Survivorship Bias is a common error of thinking where we arrive at false conclusions by examining only things that survived some selection process and ignore stuff that didn't.

The story of Abraham Wald in WW2 is a great example of this. He was asked by the RAF to find areas of planes that had been most ravaged by bullets, so the areas could be reinforce. However, instead he recommended they reinforce the areas that hadn't been touched. All the planes that had been hit there in those areas presumably didn't make it back.

You also see this the sort of content that you find spammed on LinkedIn: "10 habits of billionaries". Claims are made that billionares read 10 books a week, or always get up at 4am. That may be true. It also may be true that the vast majority of people that do this are too tired to do anything but read.

Another error of thinking like [[Confirmation Bias]].
