In Zettelkasten, the topic overview is a note that links to key notes within a topic. It is linked to via the index and serves as an entry point for a topic.

It is added when you have accumulated a large enough collections of topic notes that it becomes necessary. 

It's also the inbetween point between individual notes and a manuscript, allowing for ordering and extra annotation.

The topic overview is expected to change over time, as you develop a richer understandings. It also shows the growth of a topic. 

Luhmann collected up to 25 notes on a single topic.
