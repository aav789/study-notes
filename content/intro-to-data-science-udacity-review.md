I thought I understood the material until I tried to use it. T-tests? A thing you do to compare two samples. Linear regression? A thing you do to try to put a line through data. But when it came down to it, I really couldn't see how it would work with real numbers.

So, I left the final project to rot for a while, while I got on living: beer, 2048, True Detective and generally making the least of life.

Lesson 3 had made me regret leaving high school. It started innocently enough but by the time this formula was scralled onto the transparent table top, I was lost at sea.

I arranged to meet with my coach the following Saturday. The lines were busy or something because I never got the call.

I reread the forums. Somebody said I should rewatch the Khan Academy videos. I did but I got lost in one of the bits. I followed the prerequisites back a few steps, to Calculs. Some of it made sense but I was missing some concepts in precalculas.

I watched some earlier Khan Academy videos. Holy fuck, it is literally taught in I traced the path back to Year 7 math.

I tried to remember the lesson it was taught in but my memory doesn't go back that far.

Days passed...

## Udacity so far

* Talk about the courses I've done. What I like about it, what it means to me.

## About the Course

Intro to Data Science continues along the Data Science track boasting "...?". There are now two choices, the free option, which allows you to watch the course videos and complete the prograaming questions, and the paid option. Which, for $150 a month, you get access to a "Learning Coach" and verified certificate. I paid the money with no real intention of using the coach.

The prerequistes state that you'll need a programming background to that of their CS101 program: Computer Sciense and some stats comparable to Statistics 101. I had done the statistics course a year ago or so, but it wasn't exactly fresh on my mind

## Course Overview

### Lesson 1

"Discuss data science at a high-level". Venn diagram covers definition of a data scientist, apparently, it's a "Danger Zone" if you have "substantive expertise" and "hacking skills". I'm guessing I'm hovering around there. Talks about what data scientists do.

Pi-Chaun Chang talks about work at Google, I really enjoyed this interview and felt it fit in pretty well. Gabor Szabo talks about how a data scientists takes data and finds meaning in it.

What does it mean for a data scientist to have 'substantive expertise' was apparently a recap, but I watched the first 8 videos and couldn't see where this was mentioned. However, breaking the words apart, I guess what they're getting at is it's important to have "real life" experience in the fields you're trying to analyse.

A discussion around real world problems covered some examples of problems that you'd be expected to solve as a data scientist and some you might not consider.
