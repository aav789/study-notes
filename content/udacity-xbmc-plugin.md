2\. Text and checkbox-based quizzes (for now you'll need some sort of mouse-like device to use them).

3\. Saving your credentials to track your progress online.

4\. Bugs. Lots of them. But feel free to tell me all about them on [Github](https://github.com/lextoumbourou/plugin.video.udacity) or at the [XBMC forum](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=181462).

## [What's missing](#whats-missing)

1\. Programming quizzes aren't supported and probably never will be. XBMC doesn't really have the tools yet to support large amounts of text input.

2\. Any form of guarantee that the thing will actually work. As soon as Udacity update their API it's adios muchachos...
