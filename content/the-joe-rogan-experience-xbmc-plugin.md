The [Joe Rogan Experience][] is a video podcast that covers topics like
MMA, psychedelics, comedy, conspiracy and other things of interest to
the internet generation. Joe Rogan is an incredibly smart guy and a
surprisingly positive voice, pushing an agenda of being nicer to one
another and thinking creatively.

Guests have included Bas Rutten, Anthony Bourdaine and Tim Ferris plus
the regulars Duncan Trussell, Joey Diaz, Brian Callen, Eddie Bravo and,
of course, Brian Redban.
