title: About

My name is Lex.

I work as a developer for a large Telecommunications company in Melbourne, Australia (if you live in Australia, you've probably heard of them) developing in-house monitoring tools, mainly written in PHP, Perl and Python.

I'm also interested in [films](http://www.imdb.com/list/ONC8vcKMIs4/), [electronic music](http://www.5-footnothing.com), [productivity](http://www.justtwotasks.com), nootropics, futurology, [investing](http://www.magicranker.com) and mixed-martial arts.

This blog will usually be about developing in Python but sometimes about the above interests and sometimes just random stories. I hope I don't bore you.

If you would like to be my friend, please email me at (lextoumbourou@gmail.com). Or, follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lexandstuff), [GitHub](http://github.com/lextoumbourou) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lextoumbourou).
