title: About

My name is Lex.

I'm a Lead Engineer at [Scrunch](https://scrunch.com).

I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I write a lot of Python and wrangle data in HBase, Elasticsearch and PostGres. I DevOps a lot.

I sometimes write stuff for my [company](https://tech.scrunch.com/blog/author/lex/).

I'm also interested in fitness (boxing and strength training), music and investing.
