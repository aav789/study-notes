My name is Lex.

I work as a DevOps guy for a large Telecommunications company in Melbourne, Australia (if you live in Australia, you've probably heard of them) developing in-house monitoring tools, mainly written in PHP, Perl and Python.

At work the stack looks something like this: Ubuntu, MySQL, NGInx, RRD, Perl, PHP and JQuery then Nagios and Puppet. At home, it's more like: Ubuntu, PostGres, Apache, Python/Django and JQuery. As long as I'm building cool stuff, I don't really care, though.

I'm also interested in [films](http://www.imdb.com/list/ONC8vcKMIs4/), [electronic music](http://www.5-footnothing.com), [productivity](http://www.justtwotasks.com), nootropics, futurology, [investing](http://www.magicranker.com) and mixed-martial arts.

This blog will usually be about developing in Python but sometimes about the above interests and sometimes just random stories. I hope I don't bore you.
