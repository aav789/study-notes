# Lesson 1: Big Data

## Notes

* Data Sources
    * 90% of world's data was created in last 2 years alone
    * Cell tower data (where signal strength is highest etc)
    * Website logs
    * etc
* What is Big Data?
    * Subjective term
    * Generally described as "data too big to fit on one machine"
* Challenges
    * Data is created rapidly
    * Data in a range of formats	 	
* The 3 Vs
    * Volume - size of data
    * Variety - different formats
    * Velocity - speed it's being generated
* Using Data
    *  eCommerce - 5 minutes looking at item, send you an item to tell when item is on sale.
    *  NetFlix - based on your viewing habits, they can recommend films to you. (shout outs to [Hackers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) reference)
* Doug Cutting (one of the founders of Hadoop) Intro
    * Working on open-source search engine called "Nutch"
    * Read Google's paper on MapReduce
    * His colleague went to try to implement it in open-source project called Hadoop
    * Yahoo invested in it and he worked on it at Yahoo
    * Languages to query it like Pig
* Core Hadoop
    * Store in HDFS
        * Distributed filesystem 
    * Process with MapReduce  
        * Process HDFS as if it was on a single server
* Hadoop Ecosystem
    * Hive
        * let you write SQL that gets turned into Map/Reduce code
    * Pig
        * Another query language converted to Map/Reduce
    * Impala
        * Query your data with SQL directly accessing HDFS (bypassing compile to Map/Reduce)
    * Sqoop/Flume
        * Puts data into cluster in relational db format
    * HBase
        * Real-time DB built on HDFS 

## Takeaway

* Businesses should aim to store as much data as they can. Very little of it is worthless.
* Hadoop/HDFS has a lively ecosystem

## Opinion

Pretty simple stuff. Nothing I haven't heard before. Never hurts to hear the basics again though. :)
