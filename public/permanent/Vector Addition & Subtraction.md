Adding or subtracting 2 vectors is as simple as adding or subtracting the corresponding parts from each vector. 

$$ \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 + y_1 \\ u_2 + y_2 \end{bmatrix} $$

You can therefore only add 2 vectors that are the same size.

Vector addition is represented visually as follows:

* drawing the 1st vector
* drawing the 2nd vector starting from the tip of the 1st vector
* drawing a line from the tail of the 1st vector to the tip of the 2nd (see cover).
